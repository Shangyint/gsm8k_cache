How many chairs total does Jackson need to buy?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total number of chairs needed for the tables with 4 seats and the tables with 6 seats separately, and then add them together. First, we calculate the total number of chairs needed for the tables with 4 seats: 6 tables * 4 chairs per table = 24 chairs. Next, we calculate the total number of chairs needed for the tables with 6 seats: 12 tables * 6 chairs per table = 72 chairs. Finally, we add these two totals together: 24 + 72 = 96 chairs.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jackson needs to buy a total of 96 chairs.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 12.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216727.082221}
