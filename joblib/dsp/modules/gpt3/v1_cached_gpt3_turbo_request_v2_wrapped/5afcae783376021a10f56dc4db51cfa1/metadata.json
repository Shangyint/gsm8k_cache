This season, half his races happened in lakes and half his races happened in the ocean. He had ten total races, each of which was 3 miles long. How much time did he spend in his races?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Tyson had a total of 10 races, with half in lakes and half in the ocean. Since each race was 3 miles long, he swam a total of 30 miles. To find the total time spent in his races, we need to calculate the time spent swimming in lakes and in the ocean separately.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Tyson spent a total of 12 hours swimming in his races. In lakes, he spent 4 hours (3 miles / 3 mph = 1 hour per race, 1 hour x 4 races = 4 hours). In the ocean, he spent 8 hours (3 miles / 2.5 mph = 1.2 hours per race, 1.2 hours x 5 races = 6 hours). Adding these together, Tyson spent a total of 12 hours swimming in his races.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 3.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218232.0757709}
