She has 20 life vests on hand. 20% of her students are bringing life vests. How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Alice\\'s class has a total of 40 students, including herself. Since 20% of the students are bringing life vests, this means that 0.2 * 40 = 8 students already have life vests. Therefore, 40 - 8 = 32 students do not have life vests. Alice currently has 20 life vests on hand, so she will need 32 - 20 = 12 more life vests to ensure that every student in the class has one.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Alice will need to get 12 more life vests so that her entire class of 40 students has one.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nrationale should contain 40\\\\nrationale should contain 10\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150521.398289}
