If she sells 50% more on Sunday than she sold on Saturday, then she\\'ll have sold a total of 150 boxes on the two days. How many boxes did she sell on Saturday?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Sally sold 50% more boxes on Sunday than on Saturday, so if she sold x boxes on Saturday, she sold 1.5x boxes on Sunday. The total number of boxes sold on both days is 150, so x + 1.5x = 150. This simplifies to 2.5x = 150, and solving for x gives x = 60.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 60\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Caleb, Andy and Billy went on a picnic with their father.
