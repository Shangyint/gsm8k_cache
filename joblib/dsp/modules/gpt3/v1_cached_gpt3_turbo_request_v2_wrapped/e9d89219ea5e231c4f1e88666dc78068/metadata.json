He also wants to make 2 additional stops for food and 3 additional stops for gas. If each pit stop takes 20 minutes, how many hours will his road trip become?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Carter will stop every 2 hours to stretch his legs, which means he will make 14 / 2 = 7 leg-stretching stops. He also wants to make 2 additional stops for food and 3 additional stops for gas, totaling 7 + 2 + 3 = 12 stops. If each stop takes 20 minutes, then the total time spent on stops will be 12 * 20 = 240 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Carter\\'s road trip will become 14 hours + 4 hours = 18 hours.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218347.521504}
