The first video is 2 minutes long, the second video is 4 minutes and 30 seconds, and the last two videos are equal in length. If she spends a total of 510 seconds watching YouTube, how many seconds long was each of the last two videos?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: find the total length of the first two videos and then subtract it from the total time to find the length of the last two videos. We know that the first video is 2 minutes long, which is equal to 120 seconds. The second video is 4 minutes and 30 seconds long, which is equal to 270 seconds. Therefore, the total length of the first two videos is 120 seconds + 270 seconds = 390 seconds. To find the length of the last two videos, we subtract the total length of the first two videos from the total time Kimiko spent watching YouTube. So, 510 seconds - 390 seconds = 120 seconds. Since the last two videos are equal in length, each video is 120 seconds / 2 = 60 seconds long.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 60 seconds\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218219.955849}
