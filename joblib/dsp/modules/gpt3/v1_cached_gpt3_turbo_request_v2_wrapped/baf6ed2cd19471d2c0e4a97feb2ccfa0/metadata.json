Ella got 4 incorrect answers while Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. What is Marion\\'s score?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Ella got 4 incorrect answers, so she got 40 - 4 = 36 correct answers. Half of 36 is 18, and 6 more than that is 24. Therefore, Marion got 24 correct answers.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 24\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. The total number of shooting stars counted by all three is 14 + 12 + 16 = 42. The average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them is 42 / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 2\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday, totaling 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Therefore, Sarah has a total of 38 + 54 = 92 pencils.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 92\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Janet starts driving across a lake in a speedboat going 30 miles per hour. Her sister follows in a sailboat that has a speed of 12 miles per hour. If the lake is 60 miles wide, how long does Janet have to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. The speed difference between the two boats is 30 - 12 = 18 miles per hour. To catch up on a 60-mile wide lake, Janet\\'s sister will need to cover 60 miles at a speed of 18 miles per hour, which will take 60 / 18 = 3.33 hours. Therefore, Janet will have to wait for her sister for 3.33 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 3.33 hours\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217339.6098702}
