When the pups grow up, all the mice have another 6 pups. Then each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups due to the stress of overcrowding. How many mice are left?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We start with 8 adult mice, who each have 6 pups, so that\\'s 8 * 6 = 48 pups. When the pups grow up, they also have 6 pups each, so that\\'s 48 * 6 = 288 pups. Adding the adult mice, we have a total of 8 + 288 = 296 mice. However, each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups, so that\\'s 8 * 2 = 16 pups eaten. Therefore, the total number of mice left is 296 - 16 = 280.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 280\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Janet starts driving across a lake in a speedboat going 30 miles per hour. Her sister follows in a sailboat that has a speed of 12 miles per hour. If the lake is 60 miles wide, how long does Janet have to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can calculate the time it takes for Janet\\'s sister to catch up by finding the difference in their speeds, which is 30 - 12 = 18 miles per hour. Since the lake is 60 miles wide, it will take Janet\\'s sister 60 / 18 = 3.33 hours to catch up. Therefore, Janet will have to wait 3.33 hours for her sister to catch up.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 3.33 hours\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215356.109298}
