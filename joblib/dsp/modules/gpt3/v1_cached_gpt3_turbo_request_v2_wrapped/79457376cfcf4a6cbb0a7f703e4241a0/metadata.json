Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, and 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys. How many Buicks does Jim have?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Jim has 301 model cars in total. Let\\'s denote the number of Fords as F, the number of Chevys as C, and the number of Buicks as B. We can create the following equations based on the given information: B + F + C = 301 B = 4F F = 2C + 3 Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 4F + F + (F - 3)/2 = 301 9F - 3 = 301 9F = 304 F = 34 Now that we know the number of Fords, we can find the number of Buicks: B = 4(34) = 136\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jim has 136 Buicks.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217159.0169759}
