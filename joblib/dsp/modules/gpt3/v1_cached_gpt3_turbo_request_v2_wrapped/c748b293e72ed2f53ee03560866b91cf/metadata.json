All the trucks in his neighborhood have 4 wheels and all the cars in his neighborhood also have 4 wheels. If he saw 12 trucks and 13 cars, how many wheels did he see?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that each truck has 4 wheels and each car has 4 wheels. So, to find the total number of wheels Tommy saw, we need to multiply the number of trucks by 4 and the number of cars by 4, and then add them together. Since Tommy saw 12 trucks and 13 cars, we can calculate the total number of wheels by multiplying 12 (trucks) by 4 and 13 (cars) by 4, and then adding them together.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Tommy saw a total of 4 * 12 (trucks) + 4 * 13 (cars) = 48 + 52 = 100 wheels.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 12.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218237.217377}
