She has 145 novels, 271 comics, 419 documentaries, and 209 albums to store. She wants to put these in crates that can hold 9 items. How many crates will Natalia use? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to determine how many items Natalia has in total. We add up all the different types of books and albums she has. 145 + 271 + 419 + 209 = 1044 items. Now, we divide the total number of items by the number of items each crate can hold: 1044 / 9 = 116 crates. However, since we can\\'t have a fraction of a crate, we round down to the nearest whole number.
