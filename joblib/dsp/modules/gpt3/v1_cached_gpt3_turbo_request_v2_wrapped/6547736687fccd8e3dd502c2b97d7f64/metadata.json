This month, she worked for 160 hours and sold $25000 worth of items. Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings and the rest will be put towards insurance. How much did she allocate to insurance?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate Kristy\\'s total earnings for the month by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours worked and adding her commission on sales. So, total earnings = (7.50 * 160) + (0.16 * 25000). Then, we need to find out how much she allocated for her monthly budget, which is 95% of her total earnings. Monthly budget = 0.95 * total earnings. Finally, we can subtract her monthly budget from her total earnings to determine how much she allocated to insurance.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Kristy allocated $3,625 to insurance.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 160.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217016.0398662}
