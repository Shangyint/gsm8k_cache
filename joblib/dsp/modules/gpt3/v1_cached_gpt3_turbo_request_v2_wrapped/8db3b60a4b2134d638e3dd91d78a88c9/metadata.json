He figures it will cost him $3 a day to make his coffee. He previously bought 2 coffees a day for $4 each. How long until the machine pays for itself?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total cost of buying coffee before and after purchasing the machine, and then determine how many days it will take for the machine to pay for itself. First, let\\'s calculate the total cost of buying coffee before purchasing the machine. James bought 2 coffees a day for $4 each, so his daily cost was $8. After purchasing the machine, James will be spending $3 a day to make his own coffee. This means he will be saving $5 a day compared to buying coffee. Next, let\\'s calculate how many days it will take for the machine to pay for itself. James saved $5 a day by making his own coffee, and the machine cost $180 after the discount ($200 - $20). Therefore, it will take James $180 / $5 = 36 days for the coffee machine to pay for itself.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: It will take James 36 days for the coffee machine to pay for itself.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 2.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215595.4372082}
