If she spent $133 on her rent, how much does she deposit into her savings account in a month?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Zilla spent 7% of her monthly earnings on rent, which is $133. This means that her total monthly earnings can be calculated by dividing $133 by 7% and then multiplying by 100, which equals $1900. Half of this amount, which is $950, is spent on her other monthly expenses. Therefore, the amount she deposits into her savings account can be calculated by subtracting the rent and other expenses from her total earnings.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Zilla deposits $817 into her savings account in a month.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215130.98157}
