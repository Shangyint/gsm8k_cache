If each pit stop takes 20 minutes, how many hours will his road trip become?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Carter will make a total of 12 stops during his road trip. If each stop takes 20 minutes, then the total time spent on stops will be 12 * 20 = 240 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 4 hours\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 3.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215505.288762}
