Half of the guests are women, 15 are men, and the rest are children. In the middle of the celebration, 1/3 of the men and 5 children left. How many people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We first calculate the number of women, which is 60 / 2 = 30. Then we find the number of children, which is 60 - 30 - 15 = 15. After that, we calculate how many people left, which is 15 (men) / 3 + 5 (children) = 10. Finally, we subtract the number of people who left from the total number of guests to find out how many people stayed.\\\\nAnswer: 50\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Georgina owns a parrot and is teaching it to speak.
