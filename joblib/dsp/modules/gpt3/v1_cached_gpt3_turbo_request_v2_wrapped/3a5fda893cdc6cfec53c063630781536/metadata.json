We first need to find out how many bears Daragh had left after taking out her favorite 8 bears. Daragh had 20 bears in total, so after taking out 8, she had 20 - 8 = 12 bears left. These 12 bears were then divided equally among her 3 sisters, including Eden who already had 10 bears. So, each sister received 12 / 3 = 4 bears. Since Eden already had 10 bears, she now has 10 + 4 = 14 stuffed bears in total.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Eden now has 14 stuffed bears.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218335.4779909}
