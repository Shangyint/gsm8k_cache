If there are 90 ducks total, how many Muscovies are there?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by setting up equations for each type of duck. Let\\'s denote the number of Khaki Campbells as K, Cayugas as C, and Muscovy ducks as M. We know that M = C + 4 and C = 2K + 3. Additionally, we know that the total number of ducks is 90, so K + C + M = 90. Now we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for M.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: There are 37 Muscovy ducks.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215279.0981371}
