How many pies will they be able to bake in 7 days?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total number of pies each person can bake in 7 days by multiplying the number of pies they can bake in one day by 7. Then, we add up the total number of pies each person can bake in 7 days to find the overall total.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Eddie can bake 3 pies/day * 7 days = 21 pies in 7 days. His sister can bake 6 pies/day * 7 days = 42 pies in 7 days. His mother can bake 8 pies/day * 7 days = 56 pies in 7 days. In total, they will be able to bake 21 + 42 + 56 = 119 pies in 7 days.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: rationale should contain 3\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715149824.45857}
