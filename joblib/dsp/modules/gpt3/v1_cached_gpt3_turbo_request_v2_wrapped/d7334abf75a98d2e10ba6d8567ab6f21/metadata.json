Each student needs 5 pens, 3 notebooks, 1 binder and 2 highlighters. Pens cost $0.50, notebooks cost $1.25, binders cost $4.25, and highlighters cost $0.75. If Jackson gets a $100 teacher discount, how much does he spend on school supplies?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total cost of supplies for each student, then multiply that by the number of students. After that, we subtract the teacher discount to find the final amount spent. Since each student needs 5 pens at $0.50 each, 3 notebooks at $1.25 each, 1 binder at $4.25, and 2 highlighters at $0.75 each, the total cost per student is (5 * $0.50) + (3 * $1.25) + $4.25 + (2 * $0.75) = $2.50 + $3.75 + $4.25 + $1.50 = $12.00. Therefore, for 30 students, the total cost before the discount is $12.00 * 30 = $360. After applying the $100 teacher discount, Jackson spends $360 - $100 = $260 on school supplies.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jackson spends $260 on school supplies.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 30.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215155.689813}
