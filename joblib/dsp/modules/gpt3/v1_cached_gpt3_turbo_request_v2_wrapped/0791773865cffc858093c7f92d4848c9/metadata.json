This season, half his races happened in lakes and half his races happened in the ocean. He had ten total races, each of which was 3 miles long. How much time did he spend in his races?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can calculate the total time Tyson spent swimming in lakes and oceans separately, and then add them together to find the total time spent in his races.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Tyson spent a total of 6 hours swimming in his races. He spent 4 hours swimming in lakes (3 miles / 3 mph = 1 hour per race, 1 hour x 4 races = 4 hours) and 2 hours swimming in the ocean (3 miles / 2.5 mph = 1.2 hours per race, 1.2 hours x 5 races = 6 hours).\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 3.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151160.6653}
