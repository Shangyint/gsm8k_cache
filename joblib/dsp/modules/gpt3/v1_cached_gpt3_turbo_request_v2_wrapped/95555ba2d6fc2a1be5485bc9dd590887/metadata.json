Ella got 4 incorrect answers while Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. What is Marion\\'s score?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Ella got 4 incorrect answers, so she must have gotten 36 correct answers out of 40. Half of 36 is 18, and 6 more than that is 24. Therefore, Marion got 24 correct answers out of 40.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 24\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. The average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14 shooting stars. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 2\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then, she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday, bringing the total to 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils she has is 38 + 54 = 92.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 92\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: The company\\'s data entry team had 5 employees working on a large project. Rudy types 64 words per minute, Joyce types 76 words per minute, Gladys types 91 words per minute, Lisa types 80 words per minute and Mike types 89 words per minute. What is the team\\'s average typed words per minute?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that there are 5 employees in the team with different typing speeds. To find the average, we need to sum up the individual typing speeds and divide by the number of employees. So, the average typing speed is (64 + 76 + 91 + 80 + 89) / 5 = 80 words per minute.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 80 words per minute\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215759.575317}
