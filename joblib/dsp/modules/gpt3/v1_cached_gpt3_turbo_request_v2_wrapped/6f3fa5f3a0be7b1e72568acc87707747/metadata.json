Jerry\\'s hose can normally pump 6 gallons/minute, but due to drought restrictions, it can only pump 2/3rds as fast right now. How many minutes will it take Jerry to fill his pond?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Jerry\\'s hose can pump 4 gallons/minute during the drought.
