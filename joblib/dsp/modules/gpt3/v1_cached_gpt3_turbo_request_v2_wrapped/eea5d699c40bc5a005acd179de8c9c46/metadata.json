If in five years Hania will be 45 years old, what will Samir\\'s age be five years from now? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to determine Samir\\'s current age. If Hania will be 45 years old in five years, she is currently 45 - 5 = 40 years old. Ten years ago, Hania was 40 - 10 = 30 years old. Samir just turned half of Hania\\'s age 10 years ago, so he is currently 30 / 2 = 15 years old. In five years, Samir will be 15 + 5 = 20 years old.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Samir\\'s age will be 20 years old five years from now.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218267.133486}
