They only have few pairs of jeans left so they decided to give 10% discount on every two pairs of jeans bought by a customer at any one time. How much will a customer pay for 3 pairs of jeans?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: find the total cost for 3 pairs of jeans. First, we calculate the cost for 2 pairs of jeans after the 10% discount, which is $40 - $4 = $36. Then, we find the cost for 1 more pair of jeans, which is $36. Finally, we add these two costs together to get the total cost for 3 pairs of jeans.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: $36 + $36 = $72 for 3 pairs of jeans\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 3.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215333.719807}
