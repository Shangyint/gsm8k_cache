How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to first calculate how many students are bringing life vests, then determine how many students do not have life vests, and finally figure out how many more life vests Alice needs to provide for those students.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Alice\\'s class has 40 students, including herself, and 10 instructors, totaling 50 people. 20% of the students are bringing life vests, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 students. This means that 40 - 8 = 32 students do not have life vests. Since Alice has 20 life vests on hand, she will need 32 - 20 = 12 more life vests to ensure that every student has one.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: rationale should contain 40\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150519.389048}
