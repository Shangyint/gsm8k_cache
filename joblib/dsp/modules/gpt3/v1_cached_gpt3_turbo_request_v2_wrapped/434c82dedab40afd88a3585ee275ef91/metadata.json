Each large box takes 4 feet of packing tape to seal, each medium box takes 2 feet of packing tape to seal, and each small box takes 1 foot of packing tape to seal. Each box also takes 1 foot of packing tape to stick the address label on. Debbie packed two large boxes, eight medium boxes, and five small boxes this afternoon. How much tape did she use?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total amount of tape Debbie used. First, we calculate the tape used for the large boxes: 2 large boxes * 4 feet each = 8 feet Next, we calculate the tape used for the medium boxes: 8 medium boxes * 2 feet each = 16 feet Then, we calculate the tape used for the small boxes: 5 small boxes * 1 foot each = 5 feet Finally, we add the tape used for the address labels: 15 boxes * 1 foot each = 15 feet Adding all these together, we get: 8 feet + 16 feet + 5 feet + 15 feet = 44 feet Therefore, Debbie used 44 feet of packing tape.\\\\nAnswer: 44\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Sandy\\'s monthly phone bill expense is equal to ten times her age now.
