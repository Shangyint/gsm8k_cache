Ella got 4 incorrect answers while Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. What is Marion\\'s score?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Ella got 4 incorrect answers, so she must have gotten 36 correct answers. Half of 36 is 18, and 6 more than that is 24. Therefore, Marion got 24 correct answers.\\\\nAnswer: 24\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Sam counted 4 more shooting stars than Reginald, who counted 2 fewer than Bridget. So, Sam counted 6 more shooting stars than Bridget. To find the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them, we add up the total number of shooting stars counted by all three and divide by 3. Bridget counted 14, Reginald counted 12, and Sam counted 16. Adding these together gives us 42. Dividing by 3 gives us an average of 14 shooting stars. Therefore, Sam counted 2 more shooting stars than the average.\\\\nAnswer: 2\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday.

We can start by calculating the total number of pencils she bought on Wednesday, which is 18 * 3 = 54 pencils. Then we add up all the pencils she bought: 20 + 18 + 54 = 92 pencils.\\\\nAnswer: 92\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: There were 8000 jelly beans in a certain barrel, and 10 people lined up to take some.
