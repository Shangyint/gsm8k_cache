How much is her monthly salary if she was not able to go to work for a day?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how much Julie earns in a day by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she works, which is $5/hour x 8 hours = $40. Then, we can find out how much she earns in a week by multiplying her daily earnings by the number of days she works in a week, which is $40/day x 6 days = $240. Next, we need to determine her monthly salary by multiplying her weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month, which is $240/week x 4 weeks = $960. Since she missed a day of work, we need to subtract her daily earnings from her monthly salary, which is $960 - $40 = $920.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Julie\\'s monthly salary is $920.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 8.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215385.855859}
