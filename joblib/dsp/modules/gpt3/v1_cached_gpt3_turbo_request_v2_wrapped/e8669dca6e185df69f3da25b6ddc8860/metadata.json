How many students are in the class now?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the number of girls was 20% greater than the number of boys at the beginning of the year. This means that there were 15 boys and 15 * 1.20 = 18 girls. Later in the year, the number of girls doubled, so there are now 18 * 2 = 36 girls. The number of boys remained the same at 15. Therefore, the total number of students in the class now is 36 (girls) + 15 (boys) = 51 students.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 51 students\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215510.508493}
