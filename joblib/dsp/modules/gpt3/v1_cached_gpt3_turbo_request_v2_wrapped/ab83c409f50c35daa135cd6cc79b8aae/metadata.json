The recipe he is following calls for 2 ounces of butter for every 1 cup of baking mix; however, it allows 2 ounces of coconut oil to be substituted for the 2 ounces of butter if necessary. The chef would like to use as much butter as possible before switching over and substituting coconut oil. If the chef had 4 ounces of butter remaining, and he plans on using 6 cups of baking mix, how many ounces of coconut oil will he end up using?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: Answer: determine the amount of butter and coconut oil needed. First, we calculate the total amount of butter needed by multiplying the amount of butter per cup of baking mix by the number of cups of baking mix: 2 ounces/cup * 6 cups = 12 ounces. Since the chef only has 4 ounces of butter remaining, he will need to use 8 ounces of coconut oil to make up the difference: 12 ounces (total butter needed) - 4 ounces (remaining butter) = 8 ounces of coconut oil.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The pastry chef will end up using 8 ounces of coconut oil.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215460.103041}
