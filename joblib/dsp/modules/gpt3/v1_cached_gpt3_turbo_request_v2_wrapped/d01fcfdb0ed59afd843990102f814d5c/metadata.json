Her geography homework will take half as long as her math homework, and her science homework will take time equal to the mean amount of time she spent studying math and geography. How many minutes does Milly spend studying?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Milly\\'s geography homework will take 60/2 = 30 minutes. To find out how long her science homework will take, we need to calculate the mean amount of time she spent studying math and geography, which is (60 + 30) / 2 = 45 minutes. Therefore, Milly will spend a total of 60 + 30 + 45 = 135 minutes studying.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Milly spends 135 minutes studying.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215230.012695}
