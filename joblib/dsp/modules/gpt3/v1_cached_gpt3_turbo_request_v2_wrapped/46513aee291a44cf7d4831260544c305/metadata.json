If she receives 67.5% of male vote, what is the smallest percentage of the female she must receive to win the election?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many boys and girls are in the school. Since 60% of the students are boys, there are 120 boys and 80 girls. June needs just over 50% of the total vote to win, which means she needs at least 101 votes. If she receives 67.5% of the male vote, she will get 81 votes from the boys. This means she needs at least 20 votes from the girls to win the election. Since there are 80 girls in the school, the smallest percentage of the female vote she must receive to win the election is 25%.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: June must receive at least 25% of the female vote to win the election.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: rationale should contain 200\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150178.258069}
