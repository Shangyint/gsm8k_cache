For every 5 books you read, you get a coupon for a free donut at a nearby bakery. Quinn decided he could read 2 books a week for 10 weeks total. How many free donuts would Quinn be eligible for? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the number of free donuts Quinn would be eligible for. First, we need to find out how many books Quinn will read in total. Since he can read 2 books a week for 10 weeks, he will read 2 books/week * 10 weeks = 20 books in total. Next, we need to determine how many sets of 5 books Quinn has read. Since 20 books / 5 books/set = 4 sets, Quinn would be eligible for 4 free donuts.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Quinn would be eligible for 4 free donuts.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218525.509226}
