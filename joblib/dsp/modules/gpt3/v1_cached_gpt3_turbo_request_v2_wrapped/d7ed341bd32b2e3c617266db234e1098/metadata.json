First, we calculate the total cost of the gifts before the rebate by adding up the cost of the polo shirts, necklaces, and computer game. Then, we subtract the rebate amount to find the total cost after the rebate.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: $26 * 3 + $83 * 2 + $90 - $12 = $78 + $166 + $90 - $12 = $334 - $12 = $322.
