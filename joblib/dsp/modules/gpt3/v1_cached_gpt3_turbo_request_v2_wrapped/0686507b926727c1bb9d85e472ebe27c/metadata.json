From Hidden Lake, he has to walk back to the Park Office and it takes him 7 minutes. When he arrives there, he will have been gone from the Park Office 32 minutes altogether. If he had walked to the Lake Park restaurant from the Park office before taking the 15 minute walk to Hidden Lake, how long is the walk from Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Dante takes 15 minutes to go to Hidden Lake and 7 minutes to walk back to the Park Office. This means he spends 15 + 7 = 22 minutes walking to and from Hidden Lake. Since he will have been gone from the Park Office for 32 minutes altogether, this means he spent 32 - 22 = 10 minutes walking to the Lake Park restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 10 minutes\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215360.9873788}
