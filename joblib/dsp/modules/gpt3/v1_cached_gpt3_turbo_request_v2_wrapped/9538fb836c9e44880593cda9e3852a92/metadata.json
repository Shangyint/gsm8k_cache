If 10 of the cans are holding 8 liters each, how much oil is each of the remaining cans holding?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that there are 290 liters of oil in total and 10 cans are holding 8 liters each, which means they account for 80 liters in total. Therefore, the remaining 14 cans must hold the remaining 210 liters of oil. To find out how much oil each of the remaining cans is holding, we divide the total remaining oil by the number of remaining cans: 210 liters / 14 cans = 15 liters per can.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 15\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 290.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 24.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217133.59191}
