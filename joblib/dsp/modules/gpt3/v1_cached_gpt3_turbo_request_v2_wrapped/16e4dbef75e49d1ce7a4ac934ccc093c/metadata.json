Each large box takes 4 feet of packing tape to seal, each medium box takes 2 feet of packing tape to seal, and each small box takes 1 foot of packing tape to seal. Each box also takes 1 foot of packing tape to stick the address label on. Debbie packed two large boxes, eight medium boxes, and five small boxes this afternoon. How much tape did she use?\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 4.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total amount of tape Debbie used. First, we calculate the tape used for the large boxes: 2 large boxes * 4 feet each = 8 feet Next, we calculate the tape used for the medium boxes: 8 medium boxes * 2 feet each = 16 feet Then, we calculate the tape used for the small boxes: 5 small boxes * 1 foot each = 5 feet Finally, we add the tape used for the address labels: 15 boxes * 1 foot each = 15 feet Adding all these together, we get: 8 feet + 16 feet + 5 feet + 15 feet = 44 feet Therefore, Debbie used 44 feet of packing tape.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 44\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: A pack of dogs found a pile of bones in the dumpster behind the butcher shop. One by one, the dogs crawled into the dumpster, grabbed a mouthful of bones, and ran off with their newfound treasure. In all, there were 5 dogs. The first dog carried off 3 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog. The fourth dog carried off one bone, and the fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog carried, leaving no remaining bones in the dumpster. How many bones were in the original pile of bones?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: calculate the total number of bones in the original pile. First, we know that the fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog, so the fifth dog carried off 2 bones. The fourth dog carried off 1 bone. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog, so the third dog carried off 2 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog, so the second dog carried off 2 bones. Finally, the first dog carried off 3 bones. Adding all these together, we get: 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10 bones. Therefore, there were 10 bones in the original pile.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 10\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 5.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715214216.821394}
