The next day, one-third of the flowers in the vase were wilted. After removing the wilted flowers, how many flowers remained in the vase?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: Answer: determine the number of flowers remaining in the vase. First, we know that 3 dozen roses is equal to 36 roses. Susan gave half of the roses to her daughter, which is 36 divided by 2, equaling 18 roses. This means she placed 18 roses in the vase. The next day, one-third of the flowers in the vase were wilted, which is 18 divided by 3, equaling 6 wilted flowers. After removing the wilted flowers, we subtract 6 from the total number of flowers in the vase, which is 18. Therefore, there are 18 - 6 = 12 flowers remaining in the vase.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 12 flowers\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218462.1854239}
