Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk as they are counting and the group realizes there isn\\'t enough chalk for everyone. Erika\\\\u2019s mom brings out another 12 pieces of chalk for them to share and there is now enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each. How many pieces of chalk did Erika and her siblings originally have?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that when Erika and her 3 siblings were drawing with chalk outside, they had a certain number of chalk pieces. When the 3 friends joined, they didn\\'t have enough chalk for everyone. However, when Erika\\'s mom brought out 12 more pieces, they were able to have 3 pieces each. This means that the total number of chalk pieces they had after Erika\\'s mom brought out more chalk was enough for everyone to have 3 pieces each. We can set up an equation to solve for the original number of chalk pieces.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Erika and her siblings originally had 15 pieces of chalk.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216650.480007}
