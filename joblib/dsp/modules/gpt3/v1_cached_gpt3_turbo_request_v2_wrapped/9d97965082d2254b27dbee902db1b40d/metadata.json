If she makes 4 balls of dough one after another and then bakes them one after another when they\\'re done rising, how many hours will it take?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that it takes 3 hours for each ball of dough to rise and an additional 2 hours to bake. Since Ellen is making 4 balls of dough one after another, she will need to wait for each ball to rise before baking it. This means that the total time it will take to bake all 4 balls of dough will be the sum of the time it takes to rise and bake each ball.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: It will take a total of 20 hours (3 hours to rise + 2 hours to bake = 5 hours per ball x 4 balls = 20 hours) for Ellen to bake all 4 balls of dough.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: rationale should contain 1\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715149785.9376462}
