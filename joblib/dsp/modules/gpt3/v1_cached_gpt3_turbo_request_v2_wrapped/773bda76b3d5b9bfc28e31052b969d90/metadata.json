Half the garden gnomes have big noses instead of small noses. If six gnomes with blue hats have big noses, how many gnomes with red hats have small noses?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that three-fourths of the 28 garden gnomes have red hats, which means there are 21 gnomes with red hats. The remaining 7 gnomes have blue hats. We also know that half of the gnomes have big noses, so there are 14 gnomes with big noses and 14 gnomes with small noses. Since 6 gnomes with blue hats have big noses, there must be 8 gnomes with red hats that have big noses. Therefore, the remaining gnomes with red hats must have small noses.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 13 gnomes with red hats have small noses.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216746.742044}
