How much does he spend on pistachios per week?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many cans of pistachios James eats in 5 days. Since he eats 30 ounces every 5 days and each can is 5 ounces, he eats 6 cans in 5 days. To determine how many cans he eats in a week, we multiply 6 by 7 days, which equals 42 cans. Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying 42 cans by $10 per can, giving us $420 per week.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: James spends $420 per week on pistachios.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 30.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218437.062293}
