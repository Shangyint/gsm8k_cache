If there was a 10-minute intermission, and all the songs were 5 minutes except for one song that lasted 10 minutes, how many songs did she sing? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to determine the number of songs. First, we subtract the time of the intermission from the total concert time: 1 hour 20 minutes - 10 minutes = 1 hour 10 minutes. Next, we subtract the time of the 10-minute song from the remaining concert time: 1 hour 10 minutes - 10 minutes = 1 hour. Finally, we divide the remaining time by the duration of each 5-minute song: 1 hour / 5 minutes = 12 songs.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jay sang a total of 12 songs during the concert.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218533.86131}
