On the way, their father bought a packet of 36 candies. He gave 8 candies to Billy, 11 to Caleb and the rest to Andy. How many more candies does Andy now have than Caleb?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to first calculate how many candies each child had before the father bought the packet. Billy had 6 candies, Caleb had 11 candies, and Andy had 9 candies. After the father bought the packet, he gave 8 candies to Billy, 11 to Caleb, and the rest (17) to Andy. Therefore, Billy now has 14 candies, Caleb has 22 candies, and Andy has 26 candies. To find the difference between Andy and Caleb, we subtract 22 from 26, which gives us 4.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Andy now has 4 more candies than Caleb.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 6.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 36.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151143.393638}
