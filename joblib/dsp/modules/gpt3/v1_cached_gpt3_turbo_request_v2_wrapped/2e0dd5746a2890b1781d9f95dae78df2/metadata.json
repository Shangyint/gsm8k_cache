On the first day, she sells 5 of her friends 4 tickets each. On the second day she sells 32 tickets. How many tickets does she need to sell on the third day to meet her goal? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total number of tickets Amanda has sold so far. On the first day, she sold 5 friends 4 tickets each, which is a total of 5 * 4 = 20 tickets. On the second day, she sold 32 tickets. So far, she has sold 20 + 32 = 52 tickets. To meet her goal of 80 tickets in 3 days, she needs to sell 80 - 52 = 28 tickets on the third day.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Amanda needs to sell 28 tickets on the third day to meet her goal.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215296.0006552}
