If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes Dani brought, which is 2.5 dozen cupcakes, or 30 cupcakes. Then, we need to subtract Dani, the teacher, and the teacher\\'s aid from the total number of people, which leaves us with 27 students + 1 teacher + 1 teacher\\'s aid = 29 people. After 3 students called in sick, there are 29 - 3 = 26 people left. Therefore, after Dani gives one cupcake to each person, there are 30 cupcakes - 26 people = 4 cupcakes left.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 4 cupcakes\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218424.884785}
