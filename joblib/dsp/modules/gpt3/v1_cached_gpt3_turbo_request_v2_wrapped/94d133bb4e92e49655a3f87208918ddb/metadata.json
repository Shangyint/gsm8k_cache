But Beatrice\\'s box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert\\'s box of crayons. And Gilbert had four times as many crayons as were in Judah\\'s box of crayons. If Karen\\'s box contained 128 crayons, how many crayons were in Judah\\'s box?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Karen\\'s box contained 128 crayons, which is twice as many as Beatrice\\'s box. So, Beatrice\\'s box contained 128/2 = 64 crayons. Similarly, Beatrice\\'s box contained twice as many crayons as Gilbert\\'s box, so Gilbert\\'s box contained 64/2 = 32 crayons. Finally, Gilbert had four times as many crayons as Judah\\'s box, so Judah\\'s box contained 32/4 = 8 crayons.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Judah\\'s box contained 8 crayons.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 128.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215164.0528378}
