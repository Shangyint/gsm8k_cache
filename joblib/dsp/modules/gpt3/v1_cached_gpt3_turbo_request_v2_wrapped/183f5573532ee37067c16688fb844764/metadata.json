Puffy has three times more whiskers than Juniper, but half as many as Scruffy. Buffy has the same number of whiskers as the average number of whiskers on the three other cats. If Juniper has 12 whiskers. how many whiskers does Buffy have?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Buffy has the same number of whiskers as the average number of whiskers on the three other cats. So, we need to calculate the total number of whiskers on Puffy, Scruffy, and Juniper, which is 36 (Puffy) + 72 (Scruffy) + 12 (Juniper) = 120 whiskers. Since Buffy has the same number of whiskers as the average, we divide the total by 3 to get Buffy\\'s number of whiskers.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Buffy has 40 whiskers.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215304.2890592}
