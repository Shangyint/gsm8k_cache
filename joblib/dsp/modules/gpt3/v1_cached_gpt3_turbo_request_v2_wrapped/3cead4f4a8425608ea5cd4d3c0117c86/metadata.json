What would be the wages for 19 workers for 5 days?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the total wages for 15 workers for 6 days is $9450. To find the daily wage of one worker, we divide the total wages by the number of workers and days worked, which gives us $9450 / (15 workers * 6 days) = $105. Now, to find the wages for 19 workers for 5 days, we multiply the daily wage by the number of workers and days, which gives us $105 * (19 workers * 5 days) = $9975.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The wages for 19 workers for 5 days would be $9975.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 15.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215300.0651689}
