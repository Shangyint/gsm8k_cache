How much more money does he need so he could buy the new computer?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Troy needs $80 to buy the new computer. He already has $50 saved and will get $20 from selling his old computer. Therefore, he needs $80 - $50 - $20 = $10 more.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 10\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: A pack of dogs found a pile of bones in the dumpster behind the butcher shop. One by one, the dogs crawled into the dumpster, grabbed a mouthful of bones, and ran off with their newfound treasure. In all, there were 5 dogs. The first dog carried off 3 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog. The fourth dog carried off one bone, and the fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog carried, leaving no remaining bones in the dumpster. How many bones were in the original pile of bones?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the fifth dog carried off all the remaining bones, so the total number of bones must be the sum of what each dog carried off. The first dog carried off 3 bones, the second dog carried off 2 bones, the third dog carried off 4 bones, the fourth dog carried off 1 bone, and the fifth dog carried off 2 bones. Therefore, the total number of bones in the original pile was 3 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 12.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 12\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 5.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715214587.892701}
