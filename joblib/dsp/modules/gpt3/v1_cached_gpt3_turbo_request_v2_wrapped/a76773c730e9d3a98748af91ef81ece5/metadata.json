Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would\\'ve been the average time in seconds for the racers?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total time each runner spent running and then find the average time.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The total time Carlos spent running around the block is 3 minutes. Diego ran half the block in 2.5 minutes, so he would have taken 5 minutes to run the entire block. The total time for both runners is 3 + 5 = 8 minutes. To find the average time, we divide the total time by the number of runners, which is 2. Therefore, the average time in seconds for the racers would have been 8 minutes * 60 seconds = 480 seconds, divided by 2 runners = 240 seconds.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your reasoning should contain 3.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150791.5701709}
