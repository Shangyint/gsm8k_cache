He sells them for $20 each and uses 3/5 of the sales to buy ingredients to make meat pies for sale on the next day. How much money does Du Chin remain with after setting aside the money for buying ingredients?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how much money Du Chin makes from selling the meat pies. This can be found by multiplying the number of pies sold (200) by the price per pie ($20). So, 200 pies * $20 = $4000. Next, we need to find out how much money Du Chin uses to buy ingredients. Since he uses 3/5 of the sales, we can calculate this by multiplying the total sales ($4000) by 3/5. So, $4000 * 3/5 = $2400. Finally, to find out how much money Du Chin remains with, we subtract the amount used for buying ingredients ($2400) from the total sales ($4000). Therefore, $4000 - $2400 = $1600.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Du Chin remains with $1600 after setting aside the money for buying ingredients.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218369.593955}
