What is the fuel consumption of this car per 100 km?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the tank initially contained 47 liters of gasoline and after the journey, there were 14 liters left. This means that 47 - 14 = 33 liters of gasoline were consumed during the journey. To calculate the fuel consumption per kilometer, we need to divide the total fuel consumed (33 liters) by the total distance traveled (275 km). This gives us the fuel consumption per kilometer. To find the fuel consumption per 100 km, we can multiply this value by 100.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The fuel consumption of John\\'s car is 12 liters per 100 km.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 47.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215456.569598}
