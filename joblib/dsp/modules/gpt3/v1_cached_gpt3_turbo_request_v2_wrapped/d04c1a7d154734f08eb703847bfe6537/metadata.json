When the pups grow up, all the mice have another 6 pups. Then each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups due to the stress of overcrowding. How many mice are left?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We start with 8 adult mice, who each have 6 pups, so that\\'s 8 * 6 = 48 pups. When the pups grow up, they also have 6 pups each, so that\\'s 48 * 6 = 288 pups. Adding the adult mice, we have a total of 8 + 288 = 296 mice. However, each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups, so that\\'s 8 * 2 = 16 pups eaten. Therefore, the total number of mice left is 296 - 16 = 280.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 280\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Erika and her 3 siblings are drawing with chalk outside. Another 3 friends join them and ask if they can help with the drawing. Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk as they are counting and the group realizes there isn\\'t enough chalk for everyone. Erika\\\\u2019s mom brings out another 12 pieces of chalk for them to share and there is now enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each. How many pieces of chalk did Erika and her siblings originally have?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We start with Erika and her 3 siblings, so that\\'s 4 people. When the 3 friends join, that\\'s another 3 people, making a total of 4 + 3 = 7 people. If each person has 3 pieces of chalk, then the total number of pieces of chalk needed is 7 * 3 = 21 pieces. Erika loses 2 pieces, so the original number of pieces they had was 21 + 2 = 23 pieces.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 23\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 12.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715214409.047243}
