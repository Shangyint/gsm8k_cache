In the middle of the celebration, 1/3 of the men and 5 children left. How many people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that half of the guests are women, which means there are 30 women. There are 15 men, so the total number of adult guests is 45. The remaining guests are children, which means there are 15 children. If 1/3 of the men left, then 5 men left. If 5 children left, then there are 10 children remaining. The total number of guests who stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration is 45 (women and men) + 10 (children) = 55.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 55\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 60.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217633.887402}
