It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We first find the time it takes to saute the garlic and peppers, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes. Then, we find the total time for sauteing all the vegetables: 20 minutes + 5 minutes = 25 minutes. Next, we find the time for kneading and resting the dough: 30 minutes + 30 minutes * 2 = 90 minutes. Finally, we find the time to assemble the calzones: 90 minutes / 10 = 9 minutes. Adding up all the times, Marcus spends 25 minutes + 90 minutes + 9 minutes = 124 minutes on the calzones.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 124\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: A gumball machine has red, green, and blue gumballs. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that the number of blue gumballs is half the number of red gumballs, so there are 16/2 = 8 blue gumballs. For each blue gumball, there are 4 green gumballs, so there are 8*4 = 32 green gumballs. Therefore, the total number of gumballs in the machine is 16 (red) + 8 (blue) + 32 (green) = 56.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 56\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: A pack of dogs found a pile of bones in the dumpster behind the butcher shop. One by one, the dogs crawled into the dumpster, grabbed a mouthful of bones, and ran off with their newfound treasure. In all, there were 5 dogs. The first dog carried off 3 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog. The fourth dog carried off one bone, and the fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog carried, leaving no remaining bones in the dumpster. How many bones were in the original pile of bones?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the fifth dog carried off all the remaining bones, so the fourth dog must have carried off 1 bone. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog, so the second dog must have carried off 1 bone, making the third dog carry off 2 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog, so the first dog must have carried off 4 bones. Adding up all the bones carried off by each dog, we get 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 11 bones. Therefore, there were 11 bones in the original pile of bones.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 11\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 5.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715214092.2193122}
