During that time, Chris got sick for one week and Cathy took her shifts. If there are four weeks in a month, how many hours did Cathy work during the 2 months? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total number of hours Cathy worked. First, we find out how many weeks are in 2 months: 2 months * 4 weeks/month = 8 weeks. Since Chris was sick for 1 week, Cathy worked that week as well. Therefore, Cathy worked 8 weeks + 1 week = 9 weeks. Finally, we calculate the total hours worked by Cathy: 9 weeks * 20 hours/week = 180 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Cathy worked 180 hours during the 2 months.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215250.390729}
