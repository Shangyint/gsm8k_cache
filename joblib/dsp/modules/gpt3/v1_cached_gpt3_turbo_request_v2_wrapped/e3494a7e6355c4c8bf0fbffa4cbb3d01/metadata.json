Compared to her money, her brother has thrice as much while her sister has only half as much. How much money do the three of them have altogether? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the total amount of money the three siblings have. First, we know that Joanna has $8. Her brother has three times as much, which is 3 * $8 = $24. Her sister has half as much, which is $8 / 2 = $4. To find the total amount of money they have altogether, we add up their individual amounts: $8 + $24 + $4 = $36.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The three siblings have $36 altogether.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215225.394763}
