Marcel buys 10 ears of corn, and Dale buys half that amount. Dale buys 8 potatoes and Marcel buys some, too. If they check out together and end up buying 27 vegetables, how many potatoes did Marcel buy? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the answer. First, we know that Dale bought half the amount of corn that Marcel bought, so Dale bought 10 / 2 = 5 ears of corn. Next, we know that Marcel and Dale bought a total of 10 + 5 + 8 = 23 vegetables that are not potatoes. Therefore, Marcel bought 27 - 23 = 4 potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Marcel bought 4 potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215682.5960178}
