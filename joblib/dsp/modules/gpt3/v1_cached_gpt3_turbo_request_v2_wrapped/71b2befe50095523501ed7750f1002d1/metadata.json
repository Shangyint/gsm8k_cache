She knows each short-answer question takes 3 minutes to answer, each paragraph takes 15 minutes to write, and each essay takes an hour to write. If Karen assigns 2 essays and 5 paragraphs, how many short-answer questions should she assign if she wants to assign 4 hours of homework total?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that 2 essays will take 2 hours (2 essays * 1 hour each = 2 hours) and 5 paragraphs will take 75 minutes (5 paragraphs * 15 minutes each = 75 minutes). This totals 2 hours + 75 minutes = 3 hours and 15 minutes. Since Karen wants to assign 4 hours of homework in total, she has 45 minutes left for short-answer questions. Since each short-answer question takes 3 minutes to answer, Karen should assign 15 short-answer questions (45 minutes / 3 minutes per question = 15 questions).\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Karen should assign 15 short-answer questions.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215228.577894}
