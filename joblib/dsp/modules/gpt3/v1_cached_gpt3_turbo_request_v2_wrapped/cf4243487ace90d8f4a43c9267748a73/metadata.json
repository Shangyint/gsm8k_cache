Jeopardy is 20 minutes and Wheel of Fortune is twice as long. How many hours did he watch TV?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Jeopardy is 20 minutes long, so Wheel of Fortune is 2 * 20 = 40 minutes long. In total, James watched 2 * 20 + 2 * 40 = 120 minutes of TV.
