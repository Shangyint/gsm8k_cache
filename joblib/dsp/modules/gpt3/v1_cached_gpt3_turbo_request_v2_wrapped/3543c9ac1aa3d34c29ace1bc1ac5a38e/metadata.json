Two-fifths of Lovely\\'s books can be sold for $2.50 each and the rest for $2 each. How much will Lovely earn if all 10 books were sold?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many books Lovely can sell for $2.50 each and how many for $2 each. Since two-fifths of Lovely\\'s books can be sold for $2.50 each, this means 2/5 * 10 = 4 books can be sold for $2.50 each. The remaining books would be 10 - 4 = 6 books that can be sold for $2 each.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Lovely will earn (4 * $2.50) + (6 * $2) = $10 + $12 = $22 if all 10 books were sold.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215418.714855}
