We know that there are 14 apples in a box, so 3 boxes would contain 14 * 3 = 42 apples. Since Henry and his brother each eat 1 apple a day, they together eat 2 apples a day. Therefore, they can eat 42 apples in 42 / 2 = 21 days. To convert this into weeks, we divide by 7 days in a week.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Henry and his brother can spend 3 weeks eating 3 boxes of apples.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 14.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215436.599427}
