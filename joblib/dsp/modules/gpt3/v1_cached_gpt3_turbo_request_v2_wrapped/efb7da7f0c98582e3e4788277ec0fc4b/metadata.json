If she makes 4 balls of dough one after another and then bakes them one after another when they\\'re done rising, how many hours will it take?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that it takes 3 hours for each ball of dough to rise and an additional 2 hours to bake. Since Ellen is making 4 balls of dough one after another, she will need to wait for each ball to rise before baking it. This means that the total time it will take to bake all 4 balls of dough will be the sum of the time it takes to rise and bake each ball. However, we need to consider that while one ball is baking, the next ball can be rising. Therefore, we can overlap the rising and baking times to reduce the total time needed.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: It will take a total of 11 hours for Ellen to bake all 4 balls of dough. Here\\'s the breakdown: - The first ball of dough will take 3 hours to rise and 2 hours to bake, totaling 5 hours. - While the first ball is baking, the second ball will be rising, so the second ball will only take 2 hours to bake after the first ball is done, totaling 5 hours. - The third ball will take 3 hours to rise and 2 hours to bake, totaling 5 hours. - While the third ball is baking, the fourth ball will be rising, so the fourth ball will only take 2 hours to bake after the third ball is done, totaling 2 hours. - Adding all these times together, it will take a total of 11 hours for Ellen to bake all 4 balls of dough.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: rationale should contain 1\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715149791.996552}
