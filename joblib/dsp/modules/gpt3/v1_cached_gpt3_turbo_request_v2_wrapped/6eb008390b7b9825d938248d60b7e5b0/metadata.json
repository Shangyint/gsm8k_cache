He planted 400 rows of carrots with 300 plants in each row. He used a machine to get the planting done and it took him 20 hours. How many carrots did he plant each hour?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: Answer: calculate the number of carrots Heath planted each hour. First, we need to find the total number of carrots planted by multiplying the number of rows by the number of plants in each row. This gives us 400 rows * 300 plants = 120,000 carrots. Then, we divide the total number of carrots planted by the number of hours it took Heath to plant them. This gives us 120,000 carrots / 20 hours = 6,000 carrots planted each hour.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Heath planted 6,000 carrots each hour.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215573.4716601}
