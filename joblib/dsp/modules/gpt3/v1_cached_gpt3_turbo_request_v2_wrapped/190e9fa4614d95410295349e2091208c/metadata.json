If 50% of the chips are white and the rest are green, how many green chips are there?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the blue chips make up 10% of the total chips, so if there are three blue chips, then the total number of chips is 3 / 0.10 = 30 chips. We also know that 50% of the chips are white, so there are 30 * 0.50 = 15 white chips. The remaining chips are green, so the number of green chips is 30 - 3 (blue) - 15 (white) = 12 green chips.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: There are 12 green chips.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215317.3983748}
