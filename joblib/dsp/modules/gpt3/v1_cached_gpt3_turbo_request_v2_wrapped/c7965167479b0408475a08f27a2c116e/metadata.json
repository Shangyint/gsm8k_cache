She picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked and her parents picked 93 strawberries less than her. If her brother picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, how many strawberries would they each have if they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many strawberries Kimberly and her family picked in total. Then, we can divide that total by the number of family members to find out how many strawberries each person would have.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Kimberly picked 360 strawberries (8 x 3 x 15 = 360), her brother picked 45 strawberries (3 x 15 = 45), and her parents picked 267 strawberries (360 - 93 = 267). In total, they picked 672 strawberries (360 + 45 + 267 = 672). Dividing this total by 4 (Kimberly, her brother, and her parents) means each person would have 168 strawberries (672 / 4 = 168).\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your reasoning should contain 8.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150865.887174}
