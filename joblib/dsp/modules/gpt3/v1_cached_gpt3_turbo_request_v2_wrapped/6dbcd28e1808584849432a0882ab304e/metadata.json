Each bag of soil has 4 cubic feet. How many bags of soil will she need?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the volume of soil needed to fill both raised beds. The formula for volume is length x width x height. So, for each raised bed, the volume of soil needed is 8 feet x 4 feet x 1 foot = 32 cubic feet. Since Abby is building 2 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 cubic feet x 2 = 64 cubic feet. Since each bag of soil has 4 cubic feet, we need to divide the total volume of soil needed by the volume of each bag to find out how many bags of soil Abby will need.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Abby will need 64 cubic feet / 4 cubic feet per bag = 16 bags of soil.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215495.262203}
