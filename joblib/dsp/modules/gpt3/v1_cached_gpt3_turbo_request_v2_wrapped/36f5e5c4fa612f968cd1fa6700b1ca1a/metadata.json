If Juniper has 12 whiskers. how many whiskers does Buffy have?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Puffy has three times more whiskers than Juniper, so Puffy has 12 * 3 = 36 whiskers. We also know that Puffy has half as many whiskers as Scruffy, so Scruffy has 36 * 2 = 72 whiskers. Buffy has the same number of whiskers as the average number of whiskers on the three other cats, so Buffy has (36 + 12 + 72) / 3 = 40 whiskers.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Buffy has 40 whiskers.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215302.1651452}
