How many minutes does it take Mark to finish making the bread?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We first calculate the total time for the bread to rise, which is 120 minutes x 2 = 240 minutes. Then we add the time for kneading and baking, which is 10 minutes + 30 minutes = 40 minutes. Finally, we add all the times together to get the total time Mark takes to finish making the bread.\\\\nAnswer: 280\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Barry has $10.00 worth of dimes. His little brother, Dan has half that amount but finds 2 more dimes on his way home from school.
