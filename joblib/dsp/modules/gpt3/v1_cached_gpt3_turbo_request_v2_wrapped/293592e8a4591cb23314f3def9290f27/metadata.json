He got an 80, a 75 and a 90 on his first three tests. If he wants an 85 average for the class, what is the minimum grade he needs to get on his last test?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the average grade is calculated by adding up all the grades and dividing by the number of tests. Carl has taken three tests so far and wants an average of 85. Therefore, the total sum of his grades needs to be 85 * 4 = 340. Carl has already scored 80 + 75 + 90 = 245. To find out the minimum grade he needs on his last test, we subtract his current total from the desired total: 340 - 245 = 95.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Carl needs to get a minimum grade of 95 on his last test to achieve an 85 average for the class.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215715.499805}
