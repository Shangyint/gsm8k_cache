The next day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day. And on the third day, Eliana walked an additional 100 steps. What\\'s the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We will first calculate the total number of steps Eliana walked on the first day, which is 200 (initial steps) + 300 (additional steps) = 500 steps. On the second day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day, which is 2 * 500 = 1000 steps. Finally, on the third day, she walked an additional 100 steps. To find the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days, we add up all the steps: 500 (first day) + 1000 (second day) + 100 (third day) = 1600 steps.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Eliana walked a total of 1600 steps during these three days.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 200.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215483.200937}
