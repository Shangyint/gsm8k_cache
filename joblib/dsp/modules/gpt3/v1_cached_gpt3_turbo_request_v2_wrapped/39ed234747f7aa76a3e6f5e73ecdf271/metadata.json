The cat gets a 15-minute head start. In hours, how long will it take for the rabbit to catch up?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We need to calculate the distance the cat runs in 15 minutes, which is 5 miles (20 miles per hour * 1/4 hour). Then, we need to find out how long it will take the rabbit to cover that distance at a speed of 5 miles per hour faster (25 miles per hour - 20 miles per hour = 5 miles per hour). The rabbit will catch up at a rate of 5 miles per hour, so it will take 1 hour (5 miles / 5 miles per hour = 1 hour).\\\\nAnswer: 1\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Mark is baking bread. He has to let it rise for 120 minutes twice. He also needs to spend 10 minutes kneading it and 30 minutes baking it. How many minutes does it take Mark to finish making the bread?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We add up the time it takes for the bread to rise twice (120 minutes each time), the time it takes to knead it (10 minutes), and the time it takes to bake it (30 minutes).\\\\nAnswer: 280\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Barry has $10.00 worth of dimes. His little brother, Dan has half that amount but finds 2 more dimes on his way home from school. How many dimes does Dan have?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find out how many dimes Dan has. First, we know that Barry has $10.00 worth of dimes, which means he has 100 dimes since each dime is worth $0.10. Dan has half that amount, so he has 50 dimes. However, he finds 2 more dimes on his way home, so he now has 52 dimes in total.\\\\nAnswer: 52\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Matt wants to repaint his house.
