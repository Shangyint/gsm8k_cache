Before he read 100 pages a day. How many pages does he read a week now?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Mark used to read 2 hours a day, which is 14 hours a week. Increasing that by 150% means he now reads 3 hours a day, which is 21 hours a week. Before he read 100 pages a day, which is 700 pages a week. Now, he reads 150% more pages, which is 1750 pages a week.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 1750\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: A gumball machine has red, green, and blue gumballs. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that the number of blue gumballs is half the number of red gumballs, so there are 8 blue gumballs. For each blue gumball, there are 4 green gumballs, so there are 32 green gumballs. Adding up all the gumballs, there are 16 red + 8 blue + 32 green = 56 gumballs in total.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 56\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: There are 28 garden gnomes in a yard. Three-fourths of them have red hats, and the rest have blue hats. Half the garden gnomes have big noses instead of small noses. If six gnomes with blue hats have big noses, how many gnomes with red hats have small noses?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that three-fourths of the gnomes have red hats, which means there are 21 gnomes with red hats. The rest, which is 7 gnomes, have blue hats. Half of the gnomes have big noses, so there are 14 gnomes with big noses. Since 6 gnomes with blue hats have big noses, there must be 8 gnomes with red hats that have big noses. Therefore, the number of gnomes with red hats and small noses is 21 - 8 = 13.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 13\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 28.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217392.3613372}
