Half the garden gnomes have big noses instead of small noses. If six gnomes with blue hats have big noses, how many gnomes with red hats have small noses?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that 3/4 of the gnomes have red hats, which means 1/4 have blue hats. Since 6 gnomes with blue hats have big noses, and half of all gnomes have big noses, there must be 12 gnomes with big noses in total. Since 6 of them are gnomes with blue hats, the remaining 6 must be gnomes with red hats. Therefore, there are 6 gnomes with red hats that have small noses.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 6\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 28.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715213836.553761}
