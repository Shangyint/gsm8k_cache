We can start by finding the total cost of the jumbo shrimp and chewing gum. Since the price of a tray of jumbo shrimp is $5 and Shannon bought 5 trays, the total cost of the jumbo shrimp is $5 * 5 = $25. Since a pack of chewing gum costs half as much as a pint of frozen yogurt, and Shannon bought 2 packs, the total cost of the chewing gum is 2 * (1/2) * price of a pint of frozen yogurt. Finally, we can find the price of a pint of frozen yogurt by subtracting the total cost of the jumbo shrimp and chewing gum from the total cost of all the items.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The price of a pint of frozen yogurt is $5.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215218.051591}
