She picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked and her parents picked 93 strawberries less than her. If her brother picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, how many strawberries would they each have if they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many strawberries Kimberly\\'s brother picked, which is 3 baskets x 15 strawberries = 45 strawberries. Then, we can find out how many strawberries Kimberly picked by multiplying her brother\\'s amount by 8, which is 45 strawberries x 8 = 360 strawberries. Next, we need to find out how many strawberries her parents picked, which is 360 strawberries - 93 strawberries = 267 strawberries. In total, they picked 45 strawberries + 360 strawberries + 267 strawberries = 672 strawberries. To find out how many strawberries each person would have if they divide the total equally amongst them, we need to divide 672 strawberries by 4 family members, which equals 168 strawberries per person.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Each person would have 168 strawberries.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 8.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215290.409835}
