When the pups grow up, all the mice have another 6 pups. Then each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups due to the stress of overcrowding. How many mice are left?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We start with 8 adult mice, who each have 6 pups, so that\\'s 8 * 6 = 48 pups. When the pups grow up, they also have 6 pups each, so that\\'s 48 * 6 = 288 pups. Adding the adult mice, we have a total of 8 + 288 = 296 mice. However, each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups, so that\\'s 8 * 2 = 16 pups eaten. Therefore, the total number of mice left is 296 - 16 = 280.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 280\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: 20 birds migrate on a seasonal basis from one lake to another, searching for food. If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that each bird flies 50 miles from Jim to Disney and then 60 miles from Disney to London. So, in total, each bird flies 50 + 60 = 110 miles in two seasons. Since there are 20 birds, the combined distance they have traveled is 110 * 20 = 2200 miles.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 2200 miles\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215351.764394}
