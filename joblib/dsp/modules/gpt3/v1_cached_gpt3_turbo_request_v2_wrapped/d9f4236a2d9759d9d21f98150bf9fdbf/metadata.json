Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, and 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys. How many Buicks does Jim have?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by substituting the equation for F into the equation for B to get B = 4(2C + 3). Simplifying this, we get B = 8C + 12. Now we can substitute this expression for B into the equation for the total number of cars to get 2C + 3 + C + 8C + 12 = 301. Combining like terms, we get 11C + 15 = 301. Solving for C, we get C = 26. Now we can substitute this value back into the equation for F to get F = 2(26) + 3 = 55. Finally, we can substitute the values for F and C back into the equation for B to get B = 4(55) = 220.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jim has 220 Buicks.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217043.959052}
