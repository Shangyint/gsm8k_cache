They also sold 20 iPads for an average cost of $900 and 80 Apple TVs for an average cost of $200. What was the average cost across all products sold today?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total revenue generated from each product and then divide it by the total number of products sold. Since we are looking for the average cost across all products sold today, we need to consider the total revenue generated from all products and divide it by the total number of products sold, which is 100 iPhones + 20 iPads + 80 Apple TVs = 200 products.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The total revenue from iPhones is 100 * $1000 = $100,000. The total revenue from iPads is 20 * $900 = $18,000. The total revenue from Apple TVs is 80 * $200 = $16,000. The total revenue from all products is $100,000 + $18,000 + $16,000 = $134,000. Therefore, the average cost across all products sold today is $134,000 / 200 = $670.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 100.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215678.9808059}
