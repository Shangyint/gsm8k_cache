There are 10 students in the class, 5 of which scored a 92 on the test and 4 of which scored an 80. What would the last student have to score to at least make the teacher happy?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by finding the total score of the 9 students who have already taken the test. The total score so far is 5 students scoring 92 (5 * 92 = 460) and 4 students scoring 80 (4 * 80 = 320), which gives us a total of 780. In order to find the score the last student needs to achieve, we need to find the total score needed for the class to have an average of at least 85. Since there are 10 students in total, the class needs a total score of 10 * 85 = 850. Therefore, the last student would need to score 850 - 780 = 70 in order to make the teacher happy.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The last student would need to score 70 in order to at least make the teacher happy.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215200.915475}
