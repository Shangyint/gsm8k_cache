If basket A contains 15 apples, B has 30 mangoes, C has 20 peaches, D has 25 pears and E has some bananas, how many bananas are in basket E?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the total number of fruits in all five baskets is 5 * 25 = 125. We also know the number of fruits in baskets A, B, C, and D, which totals to 15 + 30 + 20 + 25 = 90. To find out how many bananas are in basket E, we can subtract the total fruits in the other baskets from the total fruits in all five baskets: 125 - 90 = 35. Since basket E only contains bananas, there are 35 bananas in basket E.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: There are 35 bananas in basket E.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 15.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218295.033294}
