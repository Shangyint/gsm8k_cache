Talia\\'s mom is currently three times as old as Talia is today. In three years, Talia\\'s father will be the same age as Talia\\'s mom is today. Currently, how many years old is Talia\\'s father? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the answer. 1. If in seven years Talia will be 20, then currently she is 20 - 7 = 13 years old. 2. Talia\\'s mom is currently three times as old as Talia, so her mom is 3 * 13 = 39 years old. 3. In three years, Talia\\'s father will be the same age as Talia\\'s mom is today, which means in three years, Talia\\'s father will be 39 years old. 4. Therefore, currently, Talia\\'s father is 39 - 3 = 36 years old.
