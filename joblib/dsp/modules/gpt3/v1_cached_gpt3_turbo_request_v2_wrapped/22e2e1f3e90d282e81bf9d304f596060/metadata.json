For the upcoming holiday, he has 20 shirt boxes to wrap and 12 XL boxes to wrap. If each roll of wrapping paper costs $4.00 per roll, how much will he spend to wrap all of the boxes?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many rolls of wrapping paper Harold will need to wrap all the boxes. Since each roll can wrap either 5 shirt boxes or 3 XL boxes, we can calculate the total number of rolls needed for the shirt boxes and XL boxes separately. To wrap 20 shirt boxes, Harold will need 4 rolls of wrapping paper (20 shirt boxes \\\\u00f7 5 shirt boxes per roll = 4 rolls). To wrap 12 XL boxes, he will need 4 rolls of wrapping paper (12 XL boxes \\\\u00f7 3 XL boxes per roll = 4 rolls). Therefore, he will need a total of 8 rolls of wrapping paper to wrap all the boxes.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Harold will spend a total of $32.00 to wrap all the boxes, as 8 rolls of wrapping paper are needed at $4.00 per roll.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218302.335886}
