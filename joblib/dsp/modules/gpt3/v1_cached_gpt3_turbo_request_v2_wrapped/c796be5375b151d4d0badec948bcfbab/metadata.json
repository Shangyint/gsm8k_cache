How many minutes does it take Mark to finish making the bread?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We first calculate the total time for the bread to rise, which is 120 minutes x 2 = 240 minutes. Then we add the time for kneading and baking, which is 10 minutes + 30 minutes = 40 minutes.
