He has a challenging time buying shoes because the stores only sell the shoes in pairs. If he already owns the 3-piece set of shoes he is wearing, how many pairs of shoes does he need to buy to have 5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to determine how many shoes Codger needs. Since he already has one set of shoes, he needs to buy 4 more sets to have a total of 5 sets. Each set consists of 2 shoes, so he needs to buy 4 x 2 = 8 shoes. Since shoes are sold in pairs, he needs to buy 8 / 2 = 4 pairs of shoes.
