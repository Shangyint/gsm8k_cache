The sandwich cost 3 times as much as the soup. If the soda cost $1 how much did everything cost together?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find the cost of each item. Since each soup costs as much as the 3 combined sodas, the cost of each soup is $3. The sandwich costs 3 times as much as the soup, so the sandwich costs $9. Therefore, the total cost of the sodas is $3, the total cost of the soups is $6, and the total cost of the sandwich is $9. Adding these together, the total cost of everything is $3 + $6 + $9 = $18.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: $18\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your reasoning should contain 2.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150806.3668659}
