When the pups grow up, all the mice have another 6 pups. Then each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups due to the stress of overcrowding. How many mice are left?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We start with 8 adult mice, who each have 6 pups, so that\\'s 8 * 6 = 48 pups. When the pups grow up, they also have 6 pups each, so that\\'s 48 * 6 = 288 pups. Adding the adult mice, we have a total of 8 + 288 = 296 mice. However, each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups, so that\\'s 8 * 2 = 16 pups eaten. Therefore, the total number of mice left is 296 - 16 = 280.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 280\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: An airplane was flying from California to Virginia. The flight started with 124 passengers. They made a layover in Texas. 58 passengers got off and 24 got on. From there, they flew to North Carolina, where 47 people got off and 14 got on, before flying to Virginia. There were also a total of 10 crew members on board for the entire flight. How many people landed in Virginia?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We start with 124 passengers, then 24 more got on in Texas, so that\\'s 124 + 24 = 148 passengers. After that, 47 people got off in North Carolina, but 14 more got on, so that\\'s 148 - 47 + 14 = 115 passengers. Adding the 10 crew members, we have a total of 115 + 10 = 125 people who landed in Virginia.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 125\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 58.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715214503.454659}
