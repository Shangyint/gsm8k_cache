She packs 20 pounds of water, 10 pounds of food, and 20 pounds of gear. During her hike, she drinks 2 pounds of water per hour and eats 1/3rd the weight of food per hour as water per hour. How much weight is she carrying after six hours?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how much weight Karen consumes during the hike. She drinks 2 pounds of water per hour, so after 6 hours, she would have consumed 2 * 6 = 12 pounds of water. She eats 1/3rd the weight of food per hour as water per hour, which is 1/3 * 2 = 2/3 pounds of food per hour. After 6 hours, she would have consumed 2/3 * 6 = 4 pounds of food. Next, we need to subtract the weight she consumed from the weight she packed to find out how much weight she is carrying after 6 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 34 pounds\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151502.392246}
