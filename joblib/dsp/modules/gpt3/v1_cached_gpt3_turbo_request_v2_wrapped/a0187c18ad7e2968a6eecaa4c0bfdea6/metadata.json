On the other stops, 22 passengers get off the bus and 5 passengers more get on the bus. How many passengers are there on the bus in total at the last station?\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 50.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We start with 50 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 16 more passengers get on, bringing the total to 50 + 16 = 66 passengers. Then, 22 passengers get off and 5 more get on, resulting in a total of 66 - 22 + 5 = 49 passengers on the bus at the last station.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 49\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Rudy runs 5 miles at a rate of 10 minutes per mile. Later he runs 4 miles at a rate of 9.5 minutes per mile. What is the total length of time that Rudy runs?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We start by calculating the time it takes Rudy to run 5 miles, which is 5 miles * 10 minutes/mile = 50 minutes. Then we calculate the time it takes him to run 4 miles, which is 4 miles * 9.5 minutes/mile = 38 minutes. Adding these two times together, we get a total of 50 minutes + 38 minutes = 88 minutes.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 88 minutes\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217562.5516028}
