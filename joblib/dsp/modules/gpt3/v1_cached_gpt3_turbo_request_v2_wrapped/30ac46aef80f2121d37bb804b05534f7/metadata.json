She ordered ground beef, in four-pound packages, from three different butchers. The following morning, the first butcher delivered 10 packages. A couple of hours later, 7 packages arrived from the second butcher. Finally, the third butcher\\\\u2019s delivery arrived at dusk. If all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers weighed 100 pounds, how many packages did the third butcher deliver?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by setting up equations to represent the information given in the question. Let x be the number of packages delivered by the third butcher. From the first butcher, 10 packages were delivered, each weighing 4 pounds, so 10 * 4 = 40 pounds were delivered. From the second butcher, 7 packages were delivered, each weighing 4 pounds, so 7 * 4 = 28 pounds were delivered. From the third butcher, x packages were delivered, each weighing 4 pounds, so x * 4 = 4x pounds were delivered. Adding up the total weight of ground beef delivered by all three butchers, we get: 40 + 28 + 4x = 100 68 + 4x = 100 4x = 32 x = 8\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The third butcher delivered 8 packages.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216687.4283378}
