If the number of students in the math hall is 3/5 times as many as the combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall combined, calculate the total number of students in all the halls combined.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find the number of students in the biology hall, which is twice the number in the general study hall, so 30 * 2 = 60 students. Next, we calculate the total number of students in the math hall, which is 3/5 times the combined total of the general study hall and the biology hall, so 3/5 * (30 + 60) = 3/5 * 90 = 54 students. Finally, we add up the number of students in all the halls to get the total, which is 30 + 60 + 54 = 144 students.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 144 students\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216642.5544598}
