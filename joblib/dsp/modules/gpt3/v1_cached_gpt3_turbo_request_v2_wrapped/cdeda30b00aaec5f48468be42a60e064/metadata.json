She recently went on a long trip to Bali. Palmer took 50 new pictures in the first week and twice that many in the second week. She was running out of space at the end of her trip and took only 80 new photos total across the third and fourth weeks. If she adds the pictures from Bali to her collection, how many total photos does Palmer have under her bed now?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Palmer took 50 new photos in the first week and twice that many in the second week, which is 50 x 2 = 100 photos. So, in the first two weeks, she took 50 + 100 = 150 photos. Adding the 80 photos from the third and fourth weeks, Palmer took a total of 150 + 80 = 230 new photos in Bali. If she adds these to her existing collection of 100 photos, Palmer now has 100 + 230 = 330 total photos under her bed.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Palmer has 330 total photos under her bed now.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215313.000751}
