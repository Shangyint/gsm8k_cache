We can start by dividing the total number of muffins, which is 95, by the number of muffins in each box, which is 5, to find out how many boxes are needed. This will give us the total number of boxes required to pack all the muffins. Then, we can subtract the number of available boxes, which is 10, from the total number of boxes needed to determine how many more boxes are needed to pack all the muffins.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: They still need 5 more boxes to pack all the muffins.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 95.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215442.244653}
