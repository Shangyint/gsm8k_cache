When the pups grow up, all the mice have another 6 pups. Then each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups due to the stress of overcrowding. How many mice are left?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We start with 8 adult mice, who each have 6 pups, so that\\'s 8 * 6 = 48 pups. When the pups grow up, they also have 6 pups each, so that\\'s 48 * 6 = 288 pups. Adding the adult mice, we have a total of 8 + 288 = 296 mice. However, each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups, so that\\'s 8 * 2 = 16 pups eaten. Therefore, the total number of mice left is 296 - 16 = 280.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 280\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Biff and Kenneth decide to compete in a 500-yard rowboat race. If Biff rows at a speed of 50 yards per minute and Kenneth rows at a speed of 51 yards per minute, how many yards past the finish line will Kenneth be when Biff crosses the finish line?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Kenneth rows 1 yard per minute faster than Biff. Therefore, for every minute that Biff rows, Kenneth gains 1 yard on him. Since the race is 500 yards long, Kenneth will be 500 yards - 1 yard = 499 yards past the finish line when Biff crosses the finish line.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 499\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 51.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715214559.008745}
