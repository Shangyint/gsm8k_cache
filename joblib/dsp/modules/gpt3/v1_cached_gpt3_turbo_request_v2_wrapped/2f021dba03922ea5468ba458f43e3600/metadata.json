The next day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day. And on the third day, Eliana walked an additional 100 steps. What\\'s the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We will first calculate the total number of steps Eliana walked on the first day, then on the second day, and finally on the third day. After that, we will add up all the steps to find the total.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Eliana walked 200 + 300 = 500 steps on the first day. On the second day, she walked 2 * 500 = 1000 steps. On the third day, she walked an additional 100 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days is 500 + 1000 + 100 = 1600 steps.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 200.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151229.3599832}
