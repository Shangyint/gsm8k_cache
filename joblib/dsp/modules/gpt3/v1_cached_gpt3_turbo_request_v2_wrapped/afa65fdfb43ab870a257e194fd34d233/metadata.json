Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can\\'t finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would\\'ve been the average time in seconds for the racers?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Carlos runs around the block in 3 minutes, which is equivalent to 180 seconds. Diego runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, which is equivalent to 150 seconds. If Diego had completed the entire race, he would have taken 300 seconds in total. The total time for both runners would then be 180 seconds + 300 seconds = 480 seconds. To find the average time, we divide the total time by the number of runners, which is 2. Therefore, the average time in seconds for the racers would have been 480 seconds divided by 2 runners = 240 seconds. Answer: The average time in seconds for the racers would have been 240 seconds.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: produce the answer.
