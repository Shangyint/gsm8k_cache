Let x be the number of pages in the first chapter. The second chapter will have x + 3 pages, the third chapter will have x + 6 pages, and so on. Since there are five chapters in total, the equation will be x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + (x + 9) + (x + 12) = 95.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The first chapter has 17 pages.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215094.3899531}
