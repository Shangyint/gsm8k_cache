Her sister follows in a sailboat that has a speed of 12 miles per hour. If the lake is 60 miles wide, how long does Janet have to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by calculating the time it takes for Janet to cross the lake, which is distance divided by speed. Once we have that time, we can calculate how far her sister has traveled in that time and then determine how long it will take for her sister to catch up to Janet.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Janet will have to wait for 3 hours for her sister to catch up.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 30.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151163.2525609}
