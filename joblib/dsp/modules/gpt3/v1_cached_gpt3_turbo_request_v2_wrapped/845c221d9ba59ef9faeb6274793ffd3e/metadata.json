If they decided to put together their gumballs and shared them equally, how many gumballs did each get?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many gumballs Joanna and Jacques purchased, which is 4 times the number they initially had. Joanna purchased 40 x 4 = 160 gumballs, while Jacques purchased 60 x 4 = 240 gumballs. Adding these to their initial gumballs, Joanna had a total of 40 + 160 = 200 gumballs and Jacques had 60 + 240 = 300 gumballs. Together, they had 200 + 300 = 500 gumballs. Since they decided to share them equally, each of them would get 500 / 2 = 250 gumballs.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Each of them got 250 gumballs.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218287.378527}
