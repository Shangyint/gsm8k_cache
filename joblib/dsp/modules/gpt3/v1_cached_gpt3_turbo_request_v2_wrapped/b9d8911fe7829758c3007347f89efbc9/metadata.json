Her parents bought a unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata for $13 and filled it with all of her favorite treats. They bought 4 bags of Reese\\'s for $9 per bag, 3 bags of Snickers for $5 per bag, and 5 bags of Skittles for $7 per bag. How much did the unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata and the treats cost altogether?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total cost of the unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata and the treats separately, then add them together. First, we calculate the total cost of the treats by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag for each type of candy. Then, we add the cost of the unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata to find the total cost altogether.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: $13 (unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata) + (4 bags of Reese\\'s at $9 per bag) + (3 bags of Snickers at $5 per bag) + (5 bags of Skittles at $7 per bag) = $13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $99.
