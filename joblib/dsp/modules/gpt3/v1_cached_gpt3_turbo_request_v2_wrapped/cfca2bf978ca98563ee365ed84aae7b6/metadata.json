During breakfast, they had 73 customers. During lunch, they had 127 customers. During dinner, they had 87 customers. If they predict they\\'ll get twice the amount of customers on Saturday as they had on Friday, how many customers do they predict they will get?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the total number of customers they had on Friday by adding up the customers from breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So, 73 + 127 + 87 = 287 customers on Friday. Since they predict they\\'ll get twice the amount of customers on Saturday as they had on Friday, we need to multiply 287 by 2. Therefore, they predict they will get 574 customers on Saturday.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 574 customers\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218444.8214662}
