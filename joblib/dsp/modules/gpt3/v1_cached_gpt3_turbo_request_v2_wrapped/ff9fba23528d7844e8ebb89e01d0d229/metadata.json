We first need to determine the total number of M&Ms left in the jar after Carter and his sister have eaten and added some. Then, we calculate the number of green M&Ms left in the jar. Finally, we find the percentage chance of picking a green M&M out of the total number of M&Ms.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 40%\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151869.850302}
