The wife committed to saving $100 every week while the husband committed to saving $225 every month. After 4 months of savings, they decided to invest half of their money in buying stocks. Each share of stocks costs $50. How many shares of stocks can they buy?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how much money the wife and husband saved in 4 months. The wife saved $100 every week for 4 months, which is $100 * 4 weeks/month * 4 months = $1600. The husband saved $225 every month for 4 months, which is $225 * 4 months = $900. Together, they saved $1600 + $900 = $2500. Half of $2500 is $2500 / 2 = $1250, which is the amount they will invest in buying stocks. Since each share of stocks costs $50, they can buy $1250 / $50 = 25 shares of stocks.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: They can buy 25 shares of stocks.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216657.084915}
