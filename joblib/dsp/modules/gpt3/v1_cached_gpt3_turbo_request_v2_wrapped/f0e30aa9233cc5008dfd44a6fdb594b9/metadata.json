We first need to calculate the cost of the soups, which is the same as the cost of the 3 sodas, so 3 soups cost $3. Then, the sandwich costs 3 times as much as the soup, so the sandwich costs $9. Finally, we add up the cost of the sodas, soups, and sandwich to get the total cost.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: $15.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 3.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 2.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151616.310472}
