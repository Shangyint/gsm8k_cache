The recipe he is following calls for 2 ounces of butter for every 1 cup of baking mix; however, it allows 2 ounces of coconut oil to be substituted for the 2 ounces of butter if necessary. The chef would like to use as much butter as possible before switching over and substituting coconut oil. If the chef had 4 ounces of butter remaining, and he plans on using 6 cups of baking mix, how many ounces of coconut oil will he end up using?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the total amount of butter needed by multiplying the amount of butter per cup of baking mix by the number of cups of baking mix. Then, we subtract the remaining amount of butter from the total amount needed to determine how much coconut oil will be used.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 8\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 2.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215461.5482051}
