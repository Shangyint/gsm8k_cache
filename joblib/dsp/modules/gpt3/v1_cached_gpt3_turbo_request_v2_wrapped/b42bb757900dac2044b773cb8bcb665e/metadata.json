If the price in 2001 was $1950, what was the price in 2009?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the price decreased by $35 each year. So, in 2002, the price would be $1950 - $35 = $1915. In 2003, it would be $1915 - $35 = $1880, and so on. We need to find the price in 2009, which is 8 years after 2001.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The price in 2009 would be $1950 - (8 * $35) = $1950 - $280 = $1670.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216731.296583}
