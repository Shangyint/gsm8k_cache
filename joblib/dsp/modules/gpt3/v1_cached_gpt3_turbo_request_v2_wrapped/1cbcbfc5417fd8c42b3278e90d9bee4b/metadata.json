How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that each tripodasaurus has 3 legs and 1 head. So, the total number of legs in the flock is 3 times the number of tripodasauruses and the total number of heads is the same as the number of tripodasauruses. Therefore, we can set up the following equations: 3x (number of tripodasauruses) = 20 (total legs) x = 20 / 3 x = 6.67 Since we can\\'t have a fraction of a tripodasaurus, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 6 tripodasauruses\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217148.836726}
