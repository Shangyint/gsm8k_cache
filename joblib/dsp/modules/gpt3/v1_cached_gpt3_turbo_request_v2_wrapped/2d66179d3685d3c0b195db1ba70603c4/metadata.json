How much is her monthly salary if she was not able to go to work for a day?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how much Julie earns in a day by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she works. Then, we can find out how much she earns in a week by multiplying her daily earnings by the number of days she works in a week. Finally, we can determine her monthly salary by multiplying her weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Julie earns $40 in a day ($5/hour x 8 hours), $240 in a week ($40/day x 6 days), and $960 in a month ($240/week x 4 weeks). If she misses a day of work, her monthly salary would be $920 ($960 - $40).\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: rationale should contain 8\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715149960.774709}
