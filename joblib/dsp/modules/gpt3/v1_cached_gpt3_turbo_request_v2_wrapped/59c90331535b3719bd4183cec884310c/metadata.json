He takes 2 pills each day three times a day for the first 2 days, before cutting this amount in half for the next 3 days. On the sixth day, he takes a final 2 pills in the morning and ends up feeling better. How many pills are left in the bottle?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Tony takes a total of 2 pills three times a day for the first 2 days, which is a total of 6 pills per day. So, for the first 2 days, he takes a total of 12 pills. Then, he cuts this amount in half for the next 3 days, so he takes 3 pills per day for the next 3 days, which is a total of 9 pills. Adding this to the initial 12 pills, Tony takes a total of 21 pills in the first 5 days. On the sixth day, he takes 2 more pills, bringing the total to 23 pills. Since he started with 50 pills, there are 50 - 23 = 27 pills left in the bottle.\\\\nAnswer: 27\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Georgina owns a parrot and is teaching it to speak.
