In the next five weeks, she collected ten times as many books as she did in the first week. So, if we let x be the number of books she collected in the first week, then in the next five weeks she collected 10x books. Therefore, the total number of books she has now is x + 10x = 11x. We are also given that she has 99 books now. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 99 and solve for x.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Tracy collected 9 books in the first week.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218299.377058}
