Tom ate one-third of a pizza. Sally wasn\\'t very hungry and only ate one-sixth of a pizza, and Jerry ate a quarter of a pizza. If each pizza is cut into 12 slices, how many slices were left over?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many slices each person ate in total. Bob ate 6 slices (half of 12), Tom ate 4 slices (1/3 of 12), Sally ate 2 slices (1/6 of 12), and Jerry ate 3 slices (1/4 of 12). Adding these up, they ate a total of 15 slices. Since there are 24 slices in total (2 pizzas x 12 slices), the number of slices left over is 24 - 15 = 9.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 9 slices were left over.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215125.244731}
