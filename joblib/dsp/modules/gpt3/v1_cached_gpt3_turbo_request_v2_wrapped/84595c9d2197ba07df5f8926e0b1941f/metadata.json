Each large box takes 4 feet of packing tape to seal, each medium box takes 2 feet of packing tape to seal, and each small box takes 1 foot of packing tape to seal. Each box also takes 1 foot of packing tape to stick the address label on. Debbie packed two large boxes, eight medium boxes, and five small boxes this afternoon. How much tape did she use?\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 4.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total amount of tape Debbie used. First, we calculate the tape used for the large boxes: 2 large boxes * 4 feet each = 8 feet Next, we calculate the tape used for the medium boxes: 8 medium boxes * 2 feet each = 16 feet Then, we calculate the tape used for the small boxes: 5 small boxes * 1 foot each = 5 feet Finally, we add the tape used for the address labels: 15 boxes * 1 foot each = 15 feet Adding all these together, we get: 8 feet + 16 feet + 5 feet + 15 feet = 44 feet Therefore, Debbie used 44 feet of packing tape.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 44\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Janet starts driving across a lake in a speedboat going 30 miles per hour. Her sister follows in a sailboat that has a speed of 12 miles per hour. If the lake is 60 miles wide, how long does Janet have to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: calculate how long Janet has to wait for her sister to catch up. The speed difference between the two boats is 30 - 12 = 18 miles per hour. To catch up 60 miles, it will take 60 / 18 = 3.33 hours. Therefore, Janet has to wait for her sister for approximately 3.33 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 3.33 hours\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215348.1409228}
