What does his order cost after the discount?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount, which is 7 items * $200 = $1400. Since this is over $1000, John gets a 10% discount on the amount over $1000, which is $1400 - $1000 = $400. The discount amount is 10% of $400, which is 0.10 * $400 = $40. Therefore, John\\'s order cost after the discount is $1400 - $40 = $1360.\\\\nAnswer: $1360\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Georgina owns a parrot and is teaching it to speak.
