We know that Roy spends 2 hours on sports activities in school every day and goes to school 5 days a week. So, in a normal week, he would spend 2 hours/day * 5 days/week = 10 hours on sports in school. However, if he missed 2 days within a week, we need to subtract those missed days from the total days he goes to school.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Roy spent 2 hours/day * (5 days/week - 2 missed days) = 6 hours on sports in school that week.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215100.188132}
