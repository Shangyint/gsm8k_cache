Jerry\\'s hose can normally pump 6 gallons/minute, but due to drought restrictions, it can only pump 2/3rds as fast right now. How many minutes will it take Jerry to fill his pond?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to first calculate how fast Jerry\\'s hose can pump water during the drought. Since it can only pump 2/3rds as fast as normal, we need to multiply 6 gallons/minute by 2/3. This gives us 4 gallons/minute. Next, we need to determine how many minutes it will take to fill the pond with this new pumping rate.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: It will take Jerry 50 minutes to fill his pond during the drought.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 200.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151148.2086542}
