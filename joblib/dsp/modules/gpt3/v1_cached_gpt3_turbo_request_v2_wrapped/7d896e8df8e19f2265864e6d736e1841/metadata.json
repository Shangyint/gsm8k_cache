She wins $1 for every game she wins, $0 for every game she ties, and she loses $2 for every game she loses. If she played 100 games where she tied 40 of them, and she lost $30, how many games did she win?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Sarah won $1 for every game she won, $0 for every game she tied, and she lost $2 for every game she lost. Since she lost $30 and tied 40 games, the total amount she lost from those games is $30 + 40(0) = $30. This means that the total amount she won from the games she won is $30. Since she won $1 for every game she won, the number of games she won can be calculated by dividing $30 by $1, which equals 30 games.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 30\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 100.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215518.512435}
