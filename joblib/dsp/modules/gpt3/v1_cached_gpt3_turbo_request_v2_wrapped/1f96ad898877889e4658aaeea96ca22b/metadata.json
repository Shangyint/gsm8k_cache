Each case has three packs of muffins. Each pack has four muffins. If she prices each muffin at two dollars, how many cases of muffins must she sell to raise enough money for the trip?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that each case has 3 packs of muffins, and each pack has 4 muffins. So, each case has a total of 12 muffins. If she sells each muffin for $2, then each case will bring in $24. To raise $120, she will need to sell 5 cases of muffins.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 5\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: There are 28 garden gnomes in a yard. Three-fourths of them have red hats, and the rest have blue hats. Half the garden gnomes have big noses instead of small noses. If six gnomes with blue hats have big noses, how many gnomes with red hats have small noses?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that 3/4 of the gnomes have red hats, which means 1/4 have blue hats. Since 6 gnomes with blue hats have big noses, there must be 12 gnomes with blue hats in total. This means there are 16 gnomes with red hats. Since half of the gnomes have big noses, there are 14 gnomes with small noses. Therefore, there are 2 gnomes with red hats that have small noses.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 2\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 28.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715214103.348469}
