How much kWh of electric energy does he consume per month (30 days) for using the electric fan?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that power consumption is calculated by multiplying the power of the device (in watts) by the time it is used (in hours) and then dividing by 1000 to convert to kilowatt-hours (kWh). So, the formula is: Power (in kW) = (Power (in watts) x Time (in hours)) / 1000. Given that John uses a 75-watt electric fan for 8 hours a day, we can calculate the daily energy consumption in kWh. Then, we can multiply this by 30 days to find the monthly energy consumption.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: John consumes 18 kWh of electric energy per month for using the electric fan.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218383.3204181}
