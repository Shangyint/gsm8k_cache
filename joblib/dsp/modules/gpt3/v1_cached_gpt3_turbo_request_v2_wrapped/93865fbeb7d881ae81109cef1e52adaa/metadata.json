How much change will he get from $350 if each liter of fuel costs $3?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many liters of fuel Donny needs to fill up his tank by subtracting the current fuel level from the total tank capacity. So, 150 (total tank capacity) - 38 (current fuel level) = 112 liters needed. Then, we can multiply the number of liters needed by the cost per liter to find the total cost of filling up the tank. 112 liters * $3 = $336 total cost. Finally, we can subtract this total cost from the amount Donny paid to determine the change he will receive. $350 - $336 = $14 change.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Donny will get $14 in change.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 150.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218381.146411}
