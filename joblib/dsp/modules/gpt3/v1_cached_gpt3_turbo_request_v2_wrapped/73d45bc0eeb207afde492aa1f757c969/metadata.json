Each customer needs 1 can of hairspray during the styling and is also given 1 can of hairspray to take home. The salon also buys an extra 5 cans of hairspray each day to ensure there is never a shortage.

We know that each customer needs 1 can of hairspray during the styling and is given 1 can to take home, totaling 2 cans per customer. The salon also buys an extra 5 cans each day, so the total cans bought per day is 33. Therefore, the number of customers can be calculated by dividing the total cans bought by the total cans used per customer (33 / 2).\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The salon has 16.5 customers each day, but since we can\\'t have half a customer, we can conclude that the salon has 16 customers each day.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215630.496825}
