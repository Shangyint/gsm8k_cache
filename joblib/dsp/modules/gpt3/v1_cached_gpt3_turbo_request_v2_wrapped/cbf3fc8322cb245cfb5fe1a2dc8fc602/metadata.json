Before he read 100 pages a day. How many pages does he read a week now?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Mark used to read 2 hours a day, which is 14 hours a week. Increasing that by 150% means he now reads 3 hours a day, which is 21 hours a week. Before he read 100 pages a day, which is 700 pages a week. Now, he reads 150% more pages, which is 1750 pages a week.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 1750\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: A gumball machine has red, green, and blue gumballs. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that the number of blue gumballs is half the number of red gumballs, so there are 8 blue gumballs. For each blue gumball, there are 4 green gumballs, so there are 32 green gumballs. Adding up all the gumballs, there are 16 red + 8 blue + 32 green = 56 gumballs in total.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 56\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: An airplane was flying from California to Virginia.
