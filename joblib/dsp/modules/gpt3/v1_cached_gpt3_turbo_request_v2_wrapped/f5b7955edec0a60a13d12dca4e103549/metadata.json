She wears one shirt to school for each of the five weekdays. Three days a week, she changes into a different shirt for an after-school club. On Saturday, she wears one shirt all day. On Sunday, she wears a different shirt to church than she does for the rest of the day. How many shirts does she need to be able to only do laundry once every two weeks?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total number of shirts Kendra wears in a two-week period. She wears 5 shirts for school each weekday, which totals 5 * 5 = 25 shirts. She wears 3 different shirts for after-school clubs, which totals 3 * 2 = 6 shirts. She wears 1 shirt on Saturday and 2 different shirts on Sunday, totaling 1 + 2 = 3 shirts. Adding all these up, Kendra wears a total of 25 + 6 + 3 = 34 shirts in a two-week period.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Kendra needs 34 shirts in order to only do laundry once every two weeks.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215590.213666}
