It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We first find the time it takes to saute the garlic and peppers, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes. Then, we find the total time for sauteing all the vegetables: 20 minutes + 5 minutes = 25 minutes. Next, we find the time for kneading and resting the dough: 30 minutes + 30 minutes * 2 = 90 minutes. Finally, we find the time to assemble the calzones: 90 minutes / 10 = 9 minutes. Adding up all the times, Marcus spends 25 minutes + 90 minutes + 9 minutes = 124 minutes on the calzones.\\\\nAnswer: 124\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: A gumball machine has red, green, and blue gumballs. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that the number of blue gumballs is half the number of red gumballs, so there are 16/2 = 8 blue gumballs. For each blue gumball, there are 4 green gumballs, so there are 8*4 = 32 green gumballs. Therefore, the total number of gumballs in the machine is 16 (red) + 8 (blue) + 32 (green) = 56.\\\\nAnswer: 56\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Monika went out for the day and spent some money.
