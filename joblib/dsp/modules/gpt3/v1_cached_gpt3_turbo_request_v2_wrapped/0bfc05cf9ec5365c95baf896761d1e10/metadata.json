How many inches tall is Tamara?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: find Tamara\\'s height. Let\\'s represent Kim\\'s height as x inches. According to the information given, Tamara\\'s height is 3x - 4 inches. Since their combined height is 92 inches, we can write the equation x + (3x - 4) = 92. Solving this equation will give us the value of x, which is Kim\\'s height. Once we find Kim\\'s height, we can substitute it back into the expression for Tamara\\'s height to find Tamara\\'s height.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Tamara is 33 inches tall.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215670.922889}
