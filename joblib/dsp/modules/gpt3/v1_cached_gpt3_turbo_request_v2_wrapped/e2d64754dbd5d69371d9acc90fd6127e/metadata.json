He believes it will take many of his sonnets to win her over. Each sonnet is fourteen lines long. His lady fair tells him to leave her alone after he reads her only seven sonnets, and Horatio is heartbroken over the 70 romantic lines he wrote that she never heard. How many sonnets did Horatio write in all?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Horatio read seven sonnets to his lady fair, but she left him before he could finish reading all of them. Since each sonnet is fourteen lines long, we can calculate the total number of lines she heard by multiplying 7 sonnets by 14 lines per sonnet. This will give us the total number of lines she heard. To find out how many sonnets Horatio wrote in total, we need to divide the total number of lines by 14 (since each sonnet is 14 lines long). This will give us the total number of sonnets Horatio wrote.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Horatio wrote a total of 10 sonnets.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 70.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151878.103432}
