If he reached 3/4 of the mountain\\'s height on each of his trips, calculate the total distance he covered. Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total distance Stephen covered. Since he reached 3/4 of the mountain\\'s height on each trip, he covered 3/4 * 40,000 = 30,000 feet on each trip. Since he made 10 round trips, the total distance he covered is 30,000 * 10 = 300,000 feet.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 300,000 feet\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215340.981523}
