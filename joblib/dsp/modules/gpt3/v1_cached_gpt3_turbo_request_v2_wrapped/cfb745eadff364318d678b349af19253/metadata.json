Jack scored 5 points more than Jon, and Tom scored 4 less than the points of Jon and Jack together. How many points did they score altogether? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the total points scored by Jon, Jack, and Tom. First, Jack scored 3 + 5 = 8 points. Then, Jon and Jack together scored 3 + 8 = 11 points. Finally, Tom scored 11 - 4 = 7 points. Therefore, Jon scored 3 points, Jack scored 8 points, and Tom scored 7 points. Altogether, they scored 3 + 8 + 7 = 18 points.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: They scored 18 points altogether.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215438.112138}
