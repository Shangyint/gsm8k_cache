How much is her monthly salary if she was not able to go to work for a day?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how much Julie earns in a day by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she works. Then, we can find out how much she earns in a week by multiplying her daily earnings by the number of days she works in a week. Since she works 6 days a week, her weekly earnings would be $240 ($40/day x 6 days). Finally, we can determine her monthly salary by multiplying her weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Julie\\'s monthly salary is $960 ($240/week x 4 weeks).
