The first video is 2 minutes long, the second video is 4 minutes and 30 seconds, and the last two videos are equal in length. If she spends a total of 510 seconds watching YouTube, how many seconds long was each of the last two videos? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the total length of the first two videos and then subtract it from the total time to find the length of the last two videos.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The total length of the first two videos is 2 minutes + 4 minutes and 30 seconds = 2*60 seconds + 4*60 seconds + 30 seconds = 120 seconds + 240 seconds + 30 seconds = 390 seconds. Therefore, the length of the last two videos is 510 seconds - 390 seconds = 120 seconds. Since the last two videos are equal in length, each video is 120 seconds / 2 = 60 seconds long.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218218.400204}
