Ella got 4 incorrect answers while Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. What is Marion\\'s score?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Ella got 4 incorrect answers, so she must have gotten 36 correct answers out of 40. Half of 36 is 18, and 6 more than that is 24. Therefore, Marion got 24 correct answers out of 40.\\\\nAnswer: 24\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. The average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14 shooting stars. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average.\\\\nAnswer: 2\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then, she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday, bringing the total to 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils she has is 38 + 54 = 92.\\\\nAnswer: 92\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: There were 8000 jelly beans in a certain barrel, and 10 people lined up to take some.
