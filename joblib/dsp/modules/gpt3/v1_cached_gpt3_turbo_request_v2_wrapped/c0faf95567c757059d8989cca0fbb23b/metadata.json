The other team, The Spiders, scored half the amount that The Kickers scored in the first period and twice the amount that The Kickers scored in their second period. What is the total amount of goals both teams scored?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many goals The Kickers scored in the second period. Since they scored twice the amount as in the first period, they scored 2 * 2 = 4 goals in the second period. Next, we need to calculate how many goals The Spiders scored in the first period, which is half of what The Kickers scored, so 2 / 2 = 1 goal. Finally, we need to calculate how many goals The Spiders scored in the second period, which is twice the amount that The Kickers scored, so 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Adding up all the goals scored by both teams, we get 2 + 4 + 1 + 8 = 15 goals in total.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The total amount of goals both teams scored is 15.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215663.376677}
