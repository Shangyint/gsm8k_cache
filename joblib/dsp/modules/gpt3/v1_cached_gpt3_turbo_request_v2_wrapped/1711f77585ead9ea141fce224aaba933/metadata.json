If the number of students in the math hall is 3/5 times as many as the combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall combined, calculate the total number of students in all the halls combined.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: calculate the total number of students in all the halls combined. We can start by finding the number of students in the biology hall, which is 30 students x 2 = 60 students. Next, we calculate the number of students in the math hall, which is (30 + 60) x 3/5 = 54 students. Finally, we add up all the students in the general study hall, biology hall, and math hall to get the total number of students in all the halls combined.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 30 + 60 + 54 = 144 students\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215323.5450659}
