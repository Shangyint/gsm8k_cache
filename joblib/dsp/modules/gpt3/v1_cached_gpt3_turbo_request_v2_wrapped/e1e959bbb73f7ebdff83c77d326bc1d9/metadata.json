The cost of an adult ticket is $6 more than the cost of a child ticket. The total cost of the 5 tickets is $77. What is the cost of an adult ticket?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by setting up equations to represent the given information. Let x be the cost of a child ticket. Since the cost of an adult ticket is $6 more than the cost of a child ticket, the cost of an adult ticket would be x + $6. The total cost of the 5 tickets is $77, so we can write the equation: 3x + 2(x + $6) = $77. Solving this equation will give us the cost of an adult ticket.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The cost of an adult ticket is $18.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216991.401979}
