Each large box takes 4 feet of packing tape to seal, each medium box takes 2 feet of packing tape to seal, and each small box takes 1 foot of packing tape to seal. Each box also takes 1 foot of packing tape to stick the address label on. Debbie packed two large boxes, eight medium boxes, and five small boxes this afternoon. How much tape did she use?\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 4.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total amount of tape Debbie used. First, we calculate the tape used for the large boxes: 2 large boxes * 4 feet each = 8 feet Next, we calculate the tape used for the medium boxes: 8 medium boxes * 2 feet each = 16 feet Then, we calculate the tape used for the small boxes: 5 small boxes * 1 foot each = 5 feet Finally, we add the tape used for the address labels: 15 boxes * 1 foot each = 15 feet Adding all these together, we get: 8 feet + 16 feet + 5 feet + 15 feet = 44 feet Therefore, Debbie used 44 feet of packing tape.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 44\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: It takes Jason 30 minutes to cut 1 lawn in his neighborhood. If he cuts 8 yards on both Saturday and Sunday, how many hours does he spend cutting grass?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: calculate the total time Jason spends cutting grass. First, we calculate the time spent cutting grass on Saturday and Sunday combined: 8 lawns * 30 minutes each * 2 days = 480 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 480 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 8 hours. Therefore, Jason spends 8 hours cutting grass.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 8 hours\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 1.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715214203.6873941}
