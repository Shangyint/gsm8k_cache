We first need to find out how many blueberries Mason has in total, then calculate how many muffins he made with blueberries, and finally determine the percentage of blueberry muffins out of all the muffins he made.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Mason has a total of 600 blueberries (3 cartons x 200 blueberries). He made 60 cinnamon muffins, so he used 600 blueberries for those. He also made (600 blueberries / 10 blueberries per muffin) = 60 blueberry muffins. Therefore, out of the total 120 muffins he made (60 cinnamon + 60 blueberry), 50% of them have blueberries.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your reasoning should contain 3.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150991.2305431}
