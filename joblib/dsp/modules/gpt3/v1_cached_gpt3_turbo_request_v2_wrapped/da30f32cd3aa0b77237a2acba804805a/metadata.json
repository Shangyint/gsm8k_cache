If she gave 7 pens to each student, left half of the remainder in her locker, and took the rest home, how many did she take home?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many pens Sally had left after giving 7 pens to each of the 44 students. This can be calculated by subtracting the total number of pens given to students (7 pens * 44 students = 308 pens) from the total number of pens she started with (342 pens). This leaves her with 342 - 308 = 34 pens. Next, we need to find half of the remainder, which is 34 pens / 2 = 17 pens. Sally left these 17 pens in her locker. Therefore, the number of pens she took home is the remaining pens after giving some to students and leaving half in her locker, which is 34 - 17 = 17 pens.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Sally took home 17 pens.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218400.936034}
