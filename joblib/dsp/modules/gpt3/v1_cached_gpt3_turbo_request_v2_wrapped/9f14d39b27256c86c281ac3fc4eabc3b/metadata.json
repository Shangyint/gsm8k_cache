A 10-pound bag of flour costs $10 and a 12-pound bag costs $13. When he is done making his bread, he has no use for flour and so he will throw away whatever is left. How much does he spend on flour if he buys the cheapest flour to get enough? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to determine the most cost-effective option for Tommy. Since he needs 4 pounds of flour per loaf and is making 12 loaves, he will need a total of 48 pounds of flour. Buying the 10-pound bags, he would need 5 bags which would cost him $50. If he buys the 12-pound bags, he would need 4 bags which would cost him $52.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Tommy spends $50 on flour if he buys the cheapest flour to get enough.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218305.3822908}
