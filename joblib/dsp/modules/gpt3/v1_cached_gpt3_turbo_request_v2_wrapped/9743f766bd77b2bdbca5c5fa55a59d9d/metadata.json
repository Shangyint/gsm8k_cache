If Biff rows at a speed of 50 yards per minute and Kenneth rows at a speed of 51 yards per minute, how many yards past the finish line will Kenneth be when Biff crosses the finish line?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can calculate the time it takes for Biff to cross the finish line by dividing the total distance of 500 yards by his speed of 50 yards per minute, which equals 10 minutes. In 10 minutes, Kenneth will have rowed 51 yards per minute for a total of 510 yards. Therefore, Kenneth will be 10 yards past the finish line when Biff crosses it.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Kenneth will be 10 yards past the finish line when Biff crosses it.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217017.957084}
