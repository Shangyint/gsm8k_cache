The donkey weighs 90% less than the elephant, so it weighs 10% of the elephant\\'s weight. To find the weight of the donkey, we need to calculate 10% of 6000 pounds, which is 600 pounds. Now, to find the combined weight of the donkey and the elephant, we simply add their weights together: 6000 (elephant) + 600 (donkey) = 6600 pounds.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The combined weight of the donkey and the elephant is 6600 pounds.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nrationale should contain 3\\\\nrationale should contain 2000\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715149982.553772}
