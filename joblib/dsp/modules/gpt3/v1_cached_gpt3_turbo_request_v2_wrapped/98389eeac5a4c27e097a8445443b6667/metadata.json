Ella got 4 incorrect answers while Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. What is Marion\\'s score?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We first need to find half of Ella\\'s score, which is 4 incorrect answers out of 40 questions, so Ella\\'s score is 36. Half of 36 is 18, and adding 6 to that gives us Marion\\'s score.\\\\nAnswer: 24\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. Reginald counted 2 fewer, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Sam counted 4 more than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average, we add up all the shooting stars and divide by 3: (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 42 / 3 = 14.\\\\nAnswer: 2\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We start with the 20 pencils she bought on Monday. Then, we add the 18 pencils she bought on Tuesday, which gives us 38 pencils. Finally, on Wednesday, she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 times 18, equaling 54. Adding this to the previous total of 38, we get 92 pencils in total.\\\\nAnswer: 92\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: There were 8000 jelly beans in a certain barrel, and 10 people lined up to take some.
