If the chance of randomly picking a yellow marble is 1/4, how many yellow marbles are there?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the total probability of picking a marble from the jar is 1. The probability of picking a yellow marble is 1/4. So, the total probability of picking a blue or red marble is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. This means that the blue and red marbles make up 3/4 of the total marbles. Since there are 7 blue marbles and 11 red marbles, the total number of blue and red marbles is 7 + 11 = 18. Let\\'s represent the number of yellow marbles as y. Therefore, the total number of marbles in the jar is 18 (blue and red) + y (yellow) = 18 + y. The probability of picking a yellow marble can be represented as y / (18 + y) = 1/4. Solving for y, we get y = 6.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: There are 6 yellow marbles in the jar.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215541.813269}
