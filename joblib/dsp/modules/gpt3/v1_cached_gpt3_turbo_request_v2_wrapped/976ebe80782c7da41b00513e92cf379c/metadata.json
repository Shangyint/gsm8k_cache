If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that there are 20 birds migrating between the lakes. Each bird flies the same distance, so to calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons, we need to multiply the total distance traveled by one bird by the total number of birds.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons is 2,200 miles.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nrationale should contain 20\\\\nrationale should contain 50\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715149605.538084}
