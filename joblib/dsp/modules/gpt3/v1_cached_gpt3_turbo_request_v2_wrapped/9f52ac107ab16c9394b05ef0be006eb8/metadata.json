Ella got 4 incorrect answers while Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. What is Marion\\'s score?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Ella got 4 incorrect answers, so she must have gotten 36 correct answers out of 40. Half of 36 is 18, and 6 more than that is 24. Therefore, Marion got 24 correct answers out of 40.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 24\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. The average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14 shooting stars. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 2\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then, she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday, bringing the total to 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils she has is 38 + 54 = 92.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 92\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: To try to get the class to eat more vegetables, the teacher says that she will start giving them good character points that the class can redeem for a movie day if they earn enough. The students need to earn 200 points to win the movie day. Each time a student eats their vegetables at lunch she gives the student 2 points. There are 25 students in the class. If they have two school weeks, otherwise known as 10 days to win the movie, what is the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week to get a movie day?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that each student needs to eat 10 servings of vegetables per day to earn enough points for the movie day. Since there are 25 students in the class, the total number of servings of vegetables needed per day is 10 * 25 = 250 servings. In a school week, which is 5 days, the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week to get a movie day is 250 / 25 = 10 servings of vegetables.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 10\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 25.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 200.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715214944.1136892}
