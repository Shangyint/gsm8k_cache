What is the average price he paid per movie? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the average price per movie. First, we find the total cost of the DVD movies by multiplying 8 (number of DVDs) by $12 (price per DVD). Then, we find the total cost of the Blu-ray movies by multiplying 4 (number of Blu-rays) by $18 (price per Blu-ray). Next, we add the total cost of DVDs and Blu-rays together to find the overall cost. Finally, we divide the total cost by the total number of movies (8 DVDs + 4 Blu-rays) to get the average price per movie.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The average price Chris paid per movie is $14.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218540.593876}
