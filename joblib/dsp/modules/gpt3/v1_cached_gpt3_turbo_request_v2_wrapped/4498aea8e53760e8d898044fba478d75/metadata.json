The third character only has two lines. The second character has six more than three times the number of lines the third character has. How many lines does the first character in Jerry\\\\u2019s skit script have?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by setting up equations for each character\\'s number of lines. Let\\'s denote the number of lines for the first character as x, the second character as y, and the third character as z. We know that x = y + 8, z = 2, and y = 3z + 6. We can substitute the values of z and y into the equation x = y + 8 to solve for x.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The first character in Jerry\\'s skit script has 14 lines.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218477.943243}
