Then it eats 2 more snails than it did the day before. How many apple snails in all did a snail kite eat for 5 days?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that on the first day, the snail kite ate 3 snails. Then on the second day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 3 + 2 = 5 snails. This pattern continues for the next 3 days, so on the third day it ate 5 + 2 = 7 snails, on the fourth day it ate 7 + 2 = 9 snails, and on the fifth day it ate 9 + 2 = 11 snails.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: For 5 days, a snail kite ate a total of 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 35 apple snails.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218491.477943}
