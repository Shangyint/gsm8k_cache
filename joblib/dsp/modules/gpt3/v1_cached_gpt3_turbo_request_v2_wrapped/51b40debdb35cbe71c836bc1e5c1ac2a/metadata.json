Her fingernails are 2 inches long. Her fingernails grow at a rate of one-tenth of an inch per month. How old will she be when she achieves the world record?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate how many months it will take for Sandy\\'s fingernails to grow from 2 inches to 26 inches, considering they grow at a rate of one-tenth of an inch per month. Since her fingernails are currently 2 inches long and she needs them to grow by 24 inches (26 inches - 2 inches), we can divide 24 inches by the growth rate of one-tenth of an inch per month to determine how many months it will take for her to achieve the world record.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Sandy will be 240 months old when she achieves the world record.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your reasoning should contain 12.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150977.382591}
