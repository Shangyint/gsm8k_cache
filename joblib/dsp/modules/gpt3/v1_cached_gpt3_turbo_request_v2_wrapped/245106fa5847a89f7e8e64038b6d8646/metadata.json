They made a layover in Texas. 58 passengers got off and 24 got on. From there, they flew to North Carolina, where 47 people got off and 14 got on, before flying to Virginia. There were also a total of 10 crew members on board for the entire flight. How many people landed in Virginia?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We will start with the initial number of passengers, which is 124. Then we will subtract the passengers who got off and add the passengers who got on at each layover.
