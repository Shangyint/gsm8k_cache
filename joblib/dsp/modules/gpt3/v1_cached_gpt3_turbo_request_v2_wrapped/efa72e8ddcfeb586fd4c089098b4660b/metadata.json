One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that each of them serves 7 customers per hour. So, in total, Ann, Becky, and Julia serve 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers each. However, since Julia only worked for 6 hours, she served 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers. To find the total number of customers served by all three women, we add up their individual totals: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 154 customers\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215743.555972}
