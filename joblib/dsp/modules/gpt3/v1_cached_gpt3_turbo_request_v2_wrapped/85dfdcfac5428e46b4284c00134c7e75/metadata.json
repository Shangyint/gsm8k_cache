Each sonnet is fourteen lines long. His lady fair tells him to leave her alone after he reads her only seven sonnets, and Horatio is heartbroken over the 70 romantic lines he wrote that she never heard. How many sonnets did Horatio write in all?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Horatio read seven sonnets to his lady fair, which means she heard a total of 7 * 14 = 98 lines. Since he wrote a total of 70 lines that she never heard, this means he wrote 70 / 14 = 5 sonnets that she did not hear. Therefore, in total, Horatio wrote 7 + 5 = 12 sonnets.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Horatio wrote a total of 12 sonnets.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218278.069663}
