Her sister follows in a sailboat that has a speed of 12 miles per hour. If the lake is 60 miles wide, how long does Janet have to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by calculating the time it takes for Janet to cross the lake, which is distance divided by speed. The time it takes for Janet to cross the lake is 60 miles / 30 miles per hour = 2 hours. In 2 hours, Janet will have traveled 60 miles. Since her sister is traveling at 12 miles per hour, in 2 hours, her sister will have traveled 24 miles. To catch up to Janet, her sister needs to cover the remaining distance of 60 - 24 = 36 miles. We can calculate the time it takes for her sister to cover this distance by dividing the remaining distance by her sister\\'s speed, which is 36 miles / 12 miles per hour = 3 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Janet will have to wait for 3 hours for her sister to catch up.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 30.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215272.552804}
