Her current job is 8 hours a week with a wage of $10 per hour. The new job is offering 4 hours a week with a wage of $15 per hour with an additional bonus of $35 per week if she exceeds her quota.

How much more money, in dollars, will Maisy earn at her new job?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: calculate the total earnings at each job.
