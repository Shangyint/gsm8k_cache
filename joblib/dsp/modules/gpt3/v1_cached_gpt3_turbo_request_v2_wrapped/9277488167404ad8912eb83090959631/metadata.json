Each cub needs 35 pounds a week and she has 4 cubs. She hunts rabbits, which are five pounds each. If she hunts daily, how many rabbits does she need to catch each day?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the bear needs 210 pounds of meat in a week, and each cub needs 35 pounds a week. Since she has 4 cubs, they will need a total of 4 * 35 = 140 pounds of meat. This means the bear herself needs 210 - 140 = 70 pounds of meat. Since each rabbit is 5 pounds, the bear needs to catch 70 / 5 = 14 rabbits each day in order to feed herself and her cubs.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 14 rabbits\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218254.946372}
