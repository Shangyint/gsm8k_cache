He found 12 cans at home and three times as many at his grandparents\\' house. His neighbor gave him 46. His dad brought home 250 cans from the office. His dad told him he could keep the money from the cans he brought home from the office if he promised to put half of his entire amount collected into savings. How much money would Collin have to put into savings?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to first calculate the total number of cans Collin collected by adding up the cans from home (12 cans), grandparents\\' house (3 times as many as home, so 12 x 3 = 36 cans), neighbor (46 cans), and dad\\'s office (250 cans). This gives us a total of 12 + 36 + 46 + 250 = 344 cans. Next, we need to multiply the total number of cans by $0.25 to find out how much money he earned. 344 cans x $0.25 = $86. Finally, we need to divide that amount by 2 to determine how much money Collin would have to put into savings. $86 / 2 = $43.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Collin would have to put $43 into savings.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 12.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215468.287125}
