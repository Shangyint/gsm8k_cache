Her sister follows in a sailboat that has a speed of 12 miles per hour. If the lake is 60 miles wide, how long does Janet have to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the sister\\'s sailboat is 18 miles per hour slower than Janet\\'s speedboat. Therefore, the sister will catch up at a rate of 30 - 12 = 18 miles per hour. To cover the 60-mile distance, the sister will catch up in 60 / 18 = 3.33 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 3.33 hours\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215362.75339}
