How many animals does Cara\\'s cat catch?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many animals Martha\\'s cat caught in total. Martha\\'s cat caught 3 rats + 7 birds = 10 animals. Next, we need to find out how many animals five times as many as Martha\\'s cat would catch, which is 5 * 10 = 50 animals. Since Cara\\'s cat caught 3 less than this amount, Cara\\'s cat caught 50 - 3 = 47 animals.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Cara\\'s cat catches 47 animals.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215104.505461}
