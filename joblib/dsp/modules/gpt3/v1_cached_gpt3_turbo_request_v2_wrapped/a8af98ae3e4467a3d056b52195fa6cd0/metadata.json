She ordered ground beef, in four-pound packages, from three different butchers. The following morning, the first butcher delivered 10 packages. A couple of hours later, 7 packages arrived from the second butcher. Finally, the third butcher\\\\u2019s delivery arrived at dusk. If all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers weighed 100 pounds, how many packages did the third butcher deliver?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Answer: 5 packages Reasoning: First, we add up the total number of packages delivered by the first two butchers: 10 packages + 7 packages = 17 packages. This means that the third butcher delivered 100 pounds - total weight of the first two butchers\\' deliveries (100 pounds - 4 pounds/package * 17 packages) = 32 pounds. Since each package weighs 4 pounds, the third butcher delivered 32 pounds / 4 pounds/package = 8 packages. However, since the question asks for the number of packages delivered by the third butcher, we need to subtract the initial 4 packages that were delivered by each butcher, leaving us with 8 packages - 4 packages = 4 packages.\\\\nAnswer:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151581.8562272}
