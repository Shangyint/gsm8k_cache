From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what\\'s the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to first find out how many red marbles Mary collected, then how many red marbles Anie collected, and finally add up the number of blue marbles collected by each friend. Since Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, we can use this information to calculate the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Mary collected 60 red marbles (twice as many as Jenny), Anie collected 80 red marbles (20 more than Mary), and Jenny collected 25 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 25 = 75 blue marbles.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151253.813372}
