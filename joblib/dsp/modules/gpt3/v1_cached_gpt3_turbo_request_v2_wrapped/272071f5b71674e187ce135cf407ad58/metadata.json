After that, it will take her 30 minutes to commute home, 30 minutes to grocery shop, 10 minutes to pick up the dry cleaning, 20 minutes to pick up the dog from the groomers and 90 minutes to cook dinner when she returns home. What time will she eat dinner?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to add up all the time it will take Jasmine to complete each task after work. First, she commutes home for 30 minutes, then grocery shops for 30 minutes, picks up dry cleaning for 10 minutes, picks up the dog from the groomers for 20 minutes, and finally cooks dinner for 90 minutes. Adding all these times together, we get 30 + 30 + 10 + 20 + 90 = 180 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to 3 hours. If Jasmine gets off work at 4:00 pm, she will eat dinner 3 hours later at 7:00 pm.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jasmine will eat dinner at 7:00 pm.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216670.917355}
