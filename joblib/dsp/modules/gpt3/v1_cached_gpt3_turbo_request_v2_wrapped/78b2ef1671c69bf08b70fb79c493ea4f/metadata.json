Billy took 6 candies with him, Caleb took 11 and Andy left with 9. On the way, their father bought a packet of 36 candies. He gave 8 candies to Billy, 11 to Caleb and the rest to Andy. How many more candies does Andy now have than Caleb?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many candies each child had at the beginning. Billy had 6 candies, Caleb had 11 candies, and Andy had 9 candies. Then, their father gave 8 candies to Billy and 11 candies to Caleb, leaving 17 candies for Andy. Therefore, Andy now has 26 candies (9 initial candies + 17 candies from father) and Caleb has 22 candies (11 initial candies + 11 candies from father). To find out how many more candies Andy has than Caleb, we subtract 22 from 26.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Andy now has 4 more candies than Caleb.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 6.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 36.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151746.987582}
