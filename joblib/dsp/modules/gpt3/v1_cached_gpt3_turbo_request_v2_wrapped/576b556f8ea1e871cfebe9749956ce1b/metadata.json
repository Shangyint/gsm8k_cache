We need to calculate the total height of all the trees that Jackie climbed and then divide by the number of trees to find the average height.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The average height of the trees that Jackie climbed was 800 feet. Reasoning: First, Jackie climbed a 1000 foot tall tree. Then she climbed 2 trees that were half as tall, so they were 500 feet each. Finally, she climbed a tree that was 200 feet taller than her first tree, which was 1200 feet. To find the average height, we add up all the heights (1000 + 500 + 500 + 1200) and divide by the number of trees (4). This gives us a total height of 3200 feet. Dividing by 4, we get an average height of 800 feet.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 1000.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216703.40023}
