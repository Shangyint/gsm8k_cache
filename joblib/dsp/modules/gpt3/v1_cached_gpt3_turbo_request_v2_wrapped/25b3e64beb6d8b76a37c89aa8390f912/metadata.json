Each case has three packs of muffins. Each pack has four muffins. If she prices each muffin at two dollars, how many cases of muffins must she sell to raise enough money for the trip?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that each case has 3 packs of muffins, and each pack has 4 muffins. So, each case has a total of 12 muffins. If she sells each muffin for $2, then each case will bring in $24. To raise $120, she will need to sell 5 cases of muffins.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 5\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: There are 290 liters of oil in 24 cans. If 10 of the cans are holding 8 liters each, how much oil is each of the remaining cans holding?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that there are 290 liters of oil in total and 10 cans are holding 8 liters each, which means these 10 cans hold a total of 80 liters. Therefore, the remaining 14 cans must hold 210 liters (290 - 80). To find out how much oil each of the remaining cans is holding, we divide the total amount of oil in the remaining cans by the number of cans, which gives us 15 liters per can.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 15\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 24.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715214109.612886}
