We know that each man bought 30 apples, which is 20 less than each woman bought. This means each woman bought 30 + 20 = 50 apples. So, the total number of apples bought by the two men is 2 * 30 = 60 apples, and the total number of apples bought by the three women is 3 * 50 = 150 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples bought by all five people is 60 + 150 = 210 apples.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 210 apples\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218416.428658}
