He picks up a bottle of 50 pills and takes them home. He takes 2 pills each day three times a day for the first 2 days, before cutting this amount in half for the next 3 days. On the sixth day, he takes a final 2 pills in the morning and ends up feeling better. How many pills are left in the bottle?\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 50.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Tony takes a total of 2 pills three times a day for the first 2 days, which is a total of 6 pills per day. So, for the first 2 days, he takes a total of 12 pills. Then, he cuts this amount in half for the next 3 days, so he takes 3 pills per day for the next 3 days, which is a total of 9 pills. Adding this to the initial 12 pills, Tony takes a total of 21 pills in the first 5 days. On the sixth day, he takes 2 more pills, bringing the total to 23 pills. Since he started with 50 pills, there are 50 - 23 = 27 pills left in the bottle.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 27\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Janet starts driving across a lake in a speedboat going 30 miles per hour. Her sister follows in a sailboat that has a speed of 12 miles per hour. If the lake is 60 miles wide, how long does Janet have to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the sister is going 18 miles per hour slower than Janet. So, in one hour, the sister will be 18 miles behind. To catch up, the sister needs to cover 60 miles. Dividing 60 by 18 gives us 3.33 hours. Therefore, Janet will have to wait 3 hours and 20 minutes for her sister to catch up.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 3 hours and 20 minutes\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 30.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217792.01367}
