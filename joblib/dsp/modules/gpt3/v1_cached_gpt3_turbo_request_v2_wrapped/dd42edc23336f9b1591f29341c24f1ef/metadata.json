The students need to earn 200 points to win the movie day. Each time a student eats their vegetables at lunch she gives the student 2 points. There are 25 students in the class. If they have two school weeks, otherwise known as 10 days to win the movie, what is the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week to get a movie day?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to first calculate the total number of points needed to win the movie day, which is 200 points. Then, we need to find out the total number of points that can be earned in a school week, which is 2 points per student per day for 10 days, totaling 2 * 25 * 10 = 500 points. Finally, we divide the total number of points needed by the number of school weeks to find out the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Each student must eat an average of 8 vegetables per school week to earn enough points for a movie day.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218499.88252}
