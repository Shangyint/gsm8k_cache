He increased his playtime to 7 hours a day. How long until he finishes the game?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: calculate the total hours needed to finish the game. First, we find the total hours played in 2 weeks at 4 hours per day, which is 4 hours/day * 7 days/week * 2 weeks = 56 hours. Since he is only 40% done after 56 hours, the total hours needed to finish the game is 56 hours / 0.4 = 140 hours. With the increased playtime of 7 hours per day, he will finish the game in 140 hours / 7 hours/day = 20 days.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: John will finish the game in 20 days.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217023.78294}
