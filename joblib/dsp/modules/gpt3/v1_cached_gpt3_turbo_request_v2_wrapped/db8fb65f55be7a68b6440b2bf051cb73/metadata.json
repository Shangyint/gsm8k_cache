There are 15 people on the team. On the first day, each of them gave 2 blankets. On the second day, they tripled the number they collected on the first day by asking door-to-door. On the last day, they set up boxes at schools and got a total of 22 blankets. How many blankets did they collect for the three days for donation?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that there are 15 people on the team. On the first day, each person gave 2 blankets, so the total number of blankets collected on the first day is 15 * 2 = 30 blankets. On the second day, they tripled the number collected on the first day, so they collected 30 * 3 = 90 blankets. On the last day, they collected 22 blankets. To find the total number of blankets collected for the three days, we add up the blankets collected each day: 30 + 90 + 22 = 142 blankets.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: They collected a total of 142 blankets for the three days.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 15.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215658.922657}
