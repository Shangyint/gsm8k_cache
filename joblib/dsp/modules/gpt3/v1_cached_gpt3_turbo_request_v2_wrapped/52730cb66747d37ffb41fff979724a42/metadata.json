He earned 20 points for each of the 3 exams he wrote but lost 5 points during the school year for bad behavior. How many more points can Jimmy lose and still be able to pass the next class?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Jimmy earned 20 points for each of the 3 exams, so he earned a total of 3 exams * 20 points = 60 points. He also lost 5 points for bad behavior, so his total points are 60 points - 5 points = 55 points. Since he needs at least 50 points to pass, Jimmy can lose a maximum of 55 points - 50 points = 5 more points and still be able to pass to the next class.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jimmy can lose a maximum of 5 more points and still be able to pass to the next class.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218228.4686358}
