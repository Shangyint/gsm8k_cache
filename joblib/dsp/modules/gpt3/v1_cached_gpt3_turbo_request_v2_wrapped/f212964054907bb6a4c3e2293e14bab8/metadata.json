How much more did Dan make doing the good work compared to the lower-paid work?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total amount earned for each set of tasks. For the lower-paid work, Dan earned $0.25 per task and completed 400 tasks, so he made $100 (400 tasks * $0.25/task). For the higher-paid work, Dan earned $2.00 per task and completed 5 tasks, so he made $10 (5 tasks * $2.00/task). To find out how much more Dan made doing the good work compared to the lower-paid work, we subtract the amount earned from the lower-paid work from the amount earned from the higher-paid work.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Dan made $90 more doing the good work compared to the lower-paid work.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 400.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215286.726749}
