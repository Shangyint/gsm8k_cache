During her hike, she drinks 2 pounds of water per hour and eats 1/3rd the weight of food per hour as water per hour. How much weight is she carrying after six hours?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how much weight Karen is consuming per hour. She drinks 2 pounds of water per hour and eats 1/3rd the weight of food per hour as water, which is 2/3 pounds of food per hour. So, she is consuming 2 + 2/3 = 8/3 pounds of weight per hour. After six hours, she would have consumed 8/3 * 6 = 16 pounds of weight. Therefore, she is left with 50 - 16 = 34 pounds of weight after six hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: After six hours, Karen is carrying 34 pounds of weight.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151080.624706}
