We need to calculate the total amount Lindsey saved, subtract the $25 from her mom, and then subtract the amount she spent on the video game.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Lindsey saved a total of $50 + $37 + $11 = $98. After her mom gave her $25, she had $98 - $25 = $73 left. After spending $87 on the video game, Lindsey had $73 - $87 = -$14 left.
