For the upcoming holiday, he has 20 shirt boxes to wrap and 12 XL boxes to wrap. If each roll of wrapping paper costs $4.00 per roll, how much will he spend to wrap all of the boxes?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many rolls of wrapping paper Harold will need to wrap all the boxes. Since each roll can wrap either 5 shirt boxes or 3 XL boxes, we can calculate the total number of rolls needed for the shirt boxes and XL boxes separately. Then, we can add the total number of rolls needed for both types of boxes to find the total cost.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Harold will need 4 rolls of wrapping paper for the shirt boxes (20 shirt boxes \\\\u00f7 5 shirt boxes per roll = 4 rolls) and 4 rolls of wrapping paper for the XL boxes (12 XL boxes \\\\u00f7 3 XL boxes per roll = 4 rolls). Therefore, he will need a total of 8 rolls of wrapping paper. At $4.00 per roll, Harold will spend a total of $32.00 to wrap all the boxes.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your reasoning should contain 20.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150907.542917}
