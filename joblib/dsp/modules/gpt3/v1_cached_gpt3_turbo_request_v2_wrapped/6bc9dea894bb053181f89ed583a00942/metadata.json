If she sells 50% more on Sunday than she sold on Saturday, then she\\'ll have sold a total of 150 boxes on the two days. How many boxes did she sell on Saturday?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that on Sunday, Sally sold 50% more boxes than on Saturday, which means she sold 1.5 times the number of boxes she sold on Saturday. Let\\'s represent the number of boxes sold on Saturday as x. Therefore, the number of boxes sold on Sunday is 1.5x. The total number of boxes sold on both days is x + 1.5x = 150. Solving this equation, we get x = 60.\\\\nAnswer: 60\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Sandy\\'s monthly phone bill expense is equal to ten times her age now.
