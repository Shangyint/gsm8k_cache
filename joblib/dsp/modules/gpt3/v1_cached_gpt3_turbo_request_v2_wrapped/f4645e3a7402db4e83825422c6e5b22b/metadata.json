This month, she worked for 160 hours and sold $25000 worth of items. Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings and the rest will be put towards insurance. Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total earnings of Kristy. First, we calculate her earnings from her basic salary: $7.50/hour * 160 hours = $1200. Next, we calculate her earnings from commission: 16% of $25000 = $4000. So, her total earnings are $1200 + $4000 = $5200. Now, we calculate 95% of $5200 to find out her monthly budget: 0.95 * $5200 = $4940. The amount allocated to insurance is the remaining 5% of $5200: 0.05 * $5200 = $260.
