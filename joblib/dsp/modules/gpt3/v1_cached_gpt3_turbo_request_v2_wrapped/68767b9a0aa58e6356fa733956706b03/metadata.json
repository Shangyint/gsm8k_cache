They bought 4 bags of Reese\\'s for $9 per bag, 3 bags of Snickers for $5 per bag, and 5 bags of Skittles for $7 per bag. How much did the unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata and the treats cost altogether?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total cost of the unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata and the treats separately, then add them together. First, we calculate the total cost of the treats by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag for each type of candy. Then, we add the cost of the unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata to find the total cost altogether.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The total cost of the unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata and treats is $13 (unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata) + ($9 x 4 bags of Reese\\'s) + ($5 x 3 bags of Snickers) + ($7 x 5 bags of Skittles) = $13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $99. Therefore, the unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata and treats cost $99 altogether.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: rationale should contain 4\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150009.028474}
