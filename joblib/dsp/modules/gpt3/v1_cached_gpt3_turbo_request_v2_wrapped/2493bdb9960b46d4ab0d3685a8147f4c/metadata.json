If she sells 50% more on Sunday than she sold on Saturday, then she\\'ll have sold a total of 150 boxes on the two days. How many boxes did she sell on Saturday?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Sally sells 50% more on Sunday than on Saturday. Let\\'s say she sells x boxes on Saturday. This means she sells 1.5x boxes on Sunday. Together, she sells x + 1.5x = 2.5x boxes over the two days. We also know that the total number of boxes sold is 150. Therefore, 2.5x = 150. Solving for x, we get x = 60.\\\\nAnswer: 60\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Sandy\\'s monthly phone bill expense is equal to ten times her age now.
