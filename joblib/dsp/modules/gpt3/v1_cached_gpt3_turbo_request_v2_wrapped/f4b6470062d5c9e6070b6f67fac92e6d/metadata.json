She recently went on a long trip to Bali. Palmer took 50 new pictures in the first week and twice that many in the second week. She was running out of space at the end of her trip and took only 80 new photos total across the third and fourth weeks. If she adds the pictures from Bali to her collection, how many total photos does Palmer have under her bed now? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total number of photos Palmer has. She took 50 photos in the first week, which means she took 2 * 50 = 100 photos in the second week. In the third and fourth weeks, she took 80 photos. Adding all these up, we get 50 + 100 + 80 = 230 photos from Bali. Adding this to the 100 photos she already had, Palmer now has 100 + 230 = 330 photos under her bed.
