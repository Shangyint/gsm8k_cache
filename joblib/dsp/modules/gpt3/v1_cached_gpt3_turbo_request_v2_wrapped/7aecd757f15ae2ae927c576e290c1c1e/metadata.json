Her current job is 8 hours a week with a wage of $10 per hour. The new job is offering 4 hours a week with a wage of $15 per hour with an additional bonus of $35 per week if she exceeds her quota. Maisy is confident that she will exceed her quota and decides to include this when calculating her wage at the new job. How much more money, in dollars, will Maisy earn at her new job?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate Maisy\\'s total earnings at both jobs, including the bonus at the new job, and then compare the difference. First, we calculate the total earnings at her current job by multiplying the number of hours worked per week by the wage per hour. Then, we calculate the total earnings at the new job by multiplying the number of hours worked per week by the wage per hour and adding the bonus amount. Finally, we find the difference between the total earnings at the new job and the total earnings at the current job to determine how much more money Maisy will earn at her new job.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Maisy will earn $35 more per week at her new job. To calculate: Current job: 8 hours/week * $10/hour = $80/week New job: 4 hours/week * $15/hour = $60/week Bonus at new job: $35/week Total earnings at new job: $60/week + $35/week = $95/week Difference: $95/week - $80/week = $15/week Therefore, Maisy will earn $35 more per week at her new job compared to her current job.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 8.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151290.095788}
