Before he read 100 pages a day. How many pages does he read a week now?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Mark used to read 2 hours a day, which is 14 hours a week. Increasing that by 150% means he now reads 3 hours a day, which is 21 hours a week. Before he read 100 pages a day, which is 700 pages a week. Now, he reads 150% more pages, which is 1750 pages a week.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 1750\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: A gumball machine has red, green, and blue gumballs. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that the number of blue gumballs is half the number of red gumballs, so there are 8 blue gumballs. For each blue gumball, there are 4 green gumballs, so there are 32 green gumballs. Adding up all the gumballs, there are 16 red + 8 blue + 32 green = 56 gumballs in total.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 56\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Janet starts driving across a lake in a speedboat going 30 miles per hour. Her sister follows in a sailboat that has a speed of 12 miles per hour. If the lake is 60 miles wide, how long does Janet have to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the speedboat is going 30 miles per hour and the sailboat is going 12 miles per hour. The speedboat needs to wait for the sailboat to catch up, so the difference in speed is 30 - 12 = 18 miles per hour. To cover the 60-mile distance, the sailboat will catch up in 60 / 18 = 3.33 hours. Therefore, Janet will have to wait 3.33 hours for her sister to catch up.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 3.33 hours\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715217394.087799}
