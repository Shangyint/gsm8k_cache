It takes him 20 minutes to saute the onions and a quarter of that time to saute the garlic and peppers. It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We add up the time for sauteing the onions (20 minutes), sauteing the garlic and peppers (1/4 * 20 = 5 minutes), kneading the dough (30 minutes), letting it rest (2 * 30 = 60 minutes), and assembling the calzones (1/10 * (30 + 60) = 9 minutes). Adding all these times together gives us a total of 20 + 5 + 30 + 60 + 9 = 124 minutes.\\\\nAnswer: 124\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: A gumball machine has red, green, and blue gumballs. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that the number of blue gumballs is half the number of red gumballs, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 blue gumballs. Since there are 4 times as many green gumballs as blue gumballs, there are 8 * 4 = 32 green gumballs. Adding up the total number of gumballs, we have 16 (red) + 8 (blue) + 32 (green) = 56 gumballs.\\\\nAnswer: 56\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Monika went out for the day and spent some money.
