Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, and 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys. How many Buicks does Jim have?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by setting up equations for the number of each type of car Jim has. Let\\'s denote the number of Fords as F, the number of Chevys as C, and the number of Buicks as B. We know that Jim has a total of 301 model cars, so we can write the equation: F + C + B = 301. We also know that Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, so B = 4F. Additionally, we know that Jim has 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys, so F = 2C + 3. Now we can substitute the equations for B and F into the equation for the total number of cars to solve for the number of Buicks.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jim has 76 Buicks.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215307.248765}
