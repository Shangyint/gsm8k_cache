We need to calculate the total number of pies each person can bake in 7 days separately, and then add them up to find the total number of pies baked in 7 days.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Eddie can bake 3 pies/day, his sister can bake 6 pies/day, and his mother can bake 8 pies/day. In 7 days, Eddie can bake 3 pies/day * 7 days = 21 pies, his sister can bake 6 pies/day * 7 days = 42 pies, and his mother can bake 8 pies/day * 7 days = 56 pies. Therefore, in total, they will be able to bake 21 + 42 + 56 = 119 pies in 7 days.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 3.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151133.640633}
