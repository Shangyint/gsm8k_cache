We know that when John cuts the 20-foot log in half, he will have two equal pieces. Since each linear foot of the log weighs 150 pounds, the weight of the original log is 20 feet * 150 pounds/foot = 3000 pounds. Therefore, each cut piece will weigh half of the original log\\'s weight, which is 3000 pounds / 2 = 1500 pounds.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 1500 pounds\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215652.809441}
