Half the garden gnomes have big noses instead of small noses. If six gnomes with blue hats have big noses, how many gnomes with red hats have small noses?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that there are 21 gnomes with red hats and 7 gnomes with blue hats. Since half of the gnomes have big noses, there are a total of 14 gnomes with big noses. We also know that 6 gnomes with blue hats have big noses, leaving 8 gnomes with red hats that have big noses. Therefore, the remaining gnomes with red hats must have small noses.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 13\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 28.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215240.33179}
