We first need to find out how many eggs each person collects. Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs, which is 6 x 12 = 72 eggs. Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects, so she collects 3 x 72 = 216 eggs. Trisha collects 4 dozen less than Benjamin, so she collects 72 - 4 x 12 = 24 eggs. To find the total number of eggs collected, we add up the number of eggs collected by each person: 72 + 216 + 24 = 312 eggs.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The three of them collect a total of 312 eggs.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216630.5957088}
