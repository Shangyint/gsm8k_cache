First, we know that the total cost of 5 pints of frozen yogurt, 2 packs of chewing gum, and 5 trays of jumbo shrimp is $55. Since each tray of jumbo shrimp costs $5, the total cost of the shrimp is 5 trays * $5 = $25. Next, we know that a pack of chewing gum costs half as much as a pint of frozen yogurt. Let the price of a pint of frozen yogurt be x. Therefore, the cost of 2 packs of chewing gum is 2 * (1/2)x = x. Adding the cost of the shrimp, gum, and yogurt together, we get 5x + x + 25 = $55. Simplifying this equation, we find that 6x + 25 = $55. Solving for x, we get x = $5, which is the price of a pint of frozen yogurt.\\\\nAnswer:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151638.110572}
