We know that Ariella has $200 more than Daniella, so Ariella has $400 + $200 = $600 in her son\\'s savings account. Since Ariella\\'s account earns simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum, after one year she will have $600 + ($600 * 0.10) = $660. After two years, she will have $660 + ($660 * 0.10) = $726.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Ariella will have $726 after two years.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218560.3607502}
