For them to get into the championship, they scored a total of 720 points during their previous 24 games. In the championship game, however, their opponent was much stronger than any other team they had previously gone against and they scored 2 points less than half as much as they had previously scored in each of the 24 games. Their opponent only lost by 2 points. How many points did their opponent score?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that UF scored a total of 720 points in their previous 24 games. This means they scored an average of 30 points per game. In the championship game, they scored 2 points less than half of their previous average, which is 14 points (30 divided by 2, minus 2). Since their opponent only lost by 2 points, we can calculate that their opponent scored 16 points (14 + 2).\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Their opponent scored 16 points.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215656.3793721}
