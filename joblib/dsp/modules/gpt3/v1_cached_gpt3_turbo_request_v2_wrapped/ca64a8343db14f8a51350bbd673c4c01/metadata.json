The distance between the 2 different US states increases by 40% if someone decides to drive instead of flying. Missouri is midway between Arizona and New York. How far away is Missouri from New York if someone decides to go by car?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the distance between Arizona and New York is 2,000 miles by plane. If someone decides to drive instead, the distance increases by 40%, making it 2,800 miles. Since Missouri is midway between Arizona and New York, it is half the distance from New York as it is from Arizona. Therefore, Missouri is 1,400 miles away from New York if someone decides to go by car.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 1,400 miles\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215490.209406}
