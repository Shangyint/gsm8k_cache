She finished by climbing a tree that was 200 feet taller than her first tree. What was the average height of the trees that Jackie climbed?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Answer: The average height of the trees that Jackie climbed was 650 feet. Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the average height. First, Jackie climbed a 1000 foot tall tree. Then she climbed 2 trees that were half as tall, so they were 500 feet each. Finally, she climbed a tree that was 200 feet taller than her first tree, which was 1200 feet. To find the average height, we add up all the heights (1000 + 500 + 500 + 1200) and divide by the number of trees (4). This gives us an average height of 650 feet.\\\\nAnswer:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715149645.942184}
