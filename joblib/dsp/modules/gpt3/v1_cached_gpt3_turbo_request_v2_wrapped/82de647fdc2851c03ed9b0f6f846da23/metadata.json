Two-thirds of the people who buy a ticket will buy deep-fried fair food for $8, one quarter will go on a ride for $4, and one eighth will spend $15 on a souvenir. The fair made $2520 from tickets. How many dollars did they make in all?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by calculating how much money the fair made from each additional purchase (deep-fried fair food, ride, souvenir). Then we can use the information given about the percentage of people making each purchase to calculate the total amount made from each. Finally, we can add up all the amounts made to find the total revenue.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The fair made $2520 from tickets. From additional purchases, they made $5 * (2/3) * $8 = $80 from deep-fried fair food, $5 * (1/4) * $4 = $5 from rides, and $5 * (1/8) * $15 = $9.375 from souvenirs. In total, the fair made $2520 + $80 + $5 + $9.375 = $2614.375.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215720.518786}
