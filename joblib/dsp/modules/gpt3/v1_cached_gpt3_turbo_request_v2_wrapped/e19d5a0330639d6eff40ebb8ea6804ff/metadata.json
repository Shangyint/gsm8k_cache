One balloon needs 50cm\\\\u00b3 to float high enough to touch the ceiling, and she can fill any remaining balloon with ordinary air. If she used up all of the helium and inflated every balloon, how many more balloons are touching the ceiling than not?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many balloons can be filled with the 1800cm\\\\u00b3 of helium. Then, we can determine how many balloons will touch the ceiling with the helium. Finally, we can subtract the number of balloons touching the ceiling from the total number of balloons to find out how many more balloons are touching the ceiling than not.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 10 balloons are touching the ceiling more than not.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 50.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151987.425746}
