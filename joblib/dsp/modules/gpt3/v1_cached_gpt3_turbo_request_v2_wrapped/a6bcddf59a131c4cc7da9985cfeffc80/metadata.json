What is their combined weight in pounds?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. First, we need to calculate 90% of the weight of the elephant to find the weight of the donkey. Since the elephant weighs 3 tons (3 * 2000 = 6000 pounds), 90% of 6000 pounds is 0.9 * 6000 = 5400 pounds. Therefore, the donkey weighs 5400 pounds. Next, we need to find the combined weight of the donkey and the elephant. The weight of the elephant is 6000 pounds and the weight of the donkey is 5400 pounds. So, the total combined weight is 6000 + 5400 = 11400 pounds.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The combined weight of John\\'s donkey and elephant is 11400 pounds.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 3.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215408.131916}
