If each linear foot of the log weighs 150 pounds how much does each cut piece weigh?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the original log is 20 feet long and each linear foot weighs 150 pounds. So, the total weight of the original log is 20 feet * 150 pounds/foot = 3000 pounds. When John cuts the log in half, he will have two equal pieces. Therefore, each cut piece will weigh half of the original log\\'s weight, which is 3000 pounds / 2 = 1500 pounds.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Each cut piece weighs 1500 pounds.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218492.737559}
