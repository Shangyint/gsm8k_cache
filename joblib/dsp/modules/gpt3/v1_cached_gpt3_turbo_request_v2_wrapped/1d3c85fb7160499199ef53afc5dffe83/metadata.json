The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, and there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. What is the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We will first calculate the number of snakes, which is 8 parrots * 3 = 24 snakes. Next, we will find the number of monkeys, which is 24 snakes * 2 = 48 monkeys. Then, we will calculate the number of elephants, which is (8 parrots + 24 snakes) / 2 = 16 elephants. Finally, we will determine the number of zebras, which is 16 elephants - 3 = 13 zebras. To find the difference between the zebras and the monkeys, we will subtract the number of monkeys from the number of zebras: 13 zebras - 48 monkeys = -35.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys is 35.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 8.\\\\nYour answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215260.606399}
