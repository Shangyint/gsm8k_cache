Each student needs 5 pens, 3 notebooks, 1 binder and 2 highlighters. Pens cost $0.50, notebooks cost $1.25, binders cost $4.25, and highlighters cost $0.75. If Jackson gets a $100 teacher discount, how much does he spend on school supplies?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total cost of supplies for each student and then multiply that by the number of students. After that, we subtract the teacher discount to find the final amount spent.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jackson spends (5 pens * $0.50) + (3 notebooks * $1.25) + (1 binder * $4.25) + (2 highlighters * $0.75) = $2.50 + $3.75 + $4.25 + $1.50 = $12 per student. Therefore, Jackson spends $12 * 30 students = $360 on school supplies. After the $100 teacher discount, he spends $360 - $100 = $260 on school supplies.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 30.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715151100.712063}
