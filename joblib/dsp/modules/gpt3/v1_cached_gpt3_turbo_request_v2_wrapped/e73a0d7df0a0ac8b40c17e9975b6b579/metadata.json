A family of 4 arrives and gets their oranges. They had planned to stop for a snack later where they would spend $15 in total, but now that they have the oranges they don\\'t have to buy them at the stop. When they get to the stop they see that the oranges would\\'ve cost $1.5 each. What percentage of the money they planned to spend did they save instead?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the total cost of the oranges they would\\'ve bought at the stop, which is $1.5 per orange multiplied by 4 passengers, giving us $6. Then, we can compare this amount to the total amount they planned to spend, which is $15. To find the percentage saved, we need to calculate the ratio of the money saved to the total planned spending and multiply by 100.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: They saved $6 by not buying the oranges at the stop. The total amount they planned to spend was $15. Therefore, they saved 40% of the money they planned to spend.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 4.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216983.0592}
