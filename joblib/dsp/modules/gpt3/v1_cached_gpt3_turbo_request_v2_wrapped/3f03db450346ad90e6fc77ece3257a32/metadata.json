In hours, how long will it take for the rabbit to catch up?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that the cat runs at a speed of 20 miles per hour and gets a 15-minute head start. In 15 minutes, the cat will have traveled 5 miles (20 miles per hour * 15 minutes / 60 minutes). Now, the rabbit needs to catch up 5 miles while running at a speed of 25 miles per hour. The rabbit will catch up at a rate of 5 miles per hour (25 miles per hour - 20 miles per hour). Therefore, it will take the rabbit 1 hour to catch up to the cat.\\\\nAnswer: 1\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Mark is baking bread. He has to let it rise for 120 minutes twice. He also needs to spend 10 minutes kneading it and 30 minutes baking it. How many minutes does it take Mark to finish making the bread?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We first calculate the total time for the bread to rise, which is 120 minutes x 2 = 240 minutes. Then we add the time for kneading and baking, which is 10 minutes + 30 minutes = 40 minutes. Finally, we add all the times together to find the total time Mark takes to finish making the bread.\\\\nAnswer: 280\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: James watched 2 episodes of Jeopardy and 2 episodes of Wheel of Fortune. Jeopardy is 20 minutes and Wheel of Fortune is twice as long. How many hours did he watch TV?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that James watched 2 episodes of Jeopardy, which is 20 minutes each, so that\\'s 40 minutes total. He also watched 2 episodes of Wheel of Fortune, which is twice as long as Jeopardy, so that\\'s 40 minutes x 2 = 80 minutes. To find out how many hours he watched TV, we need to convert the total minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 40 minutes + 80 minutes = 120 minutes total. 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.\\\\nAnswer: 2\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Matt wants to repaint his house.
