How many hoodies does Fiona own? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find out how many hoodies Fiona owns. Let\\'s denote the number of hoodies Fiona owns as x. Since Casey owns two more than Fiona, Casey owns x + 2 hoodies. Together, they own 8 hoodies, so we can write the equation x + (x + 2) = 8. Solving this equation, we get 2x + 2 = 8, which simplifies to 2x = 6 and x = 3. Therefore, Fiona owns 3 hoodies.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Fiona owns 3 hoodies.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215638.959776}
