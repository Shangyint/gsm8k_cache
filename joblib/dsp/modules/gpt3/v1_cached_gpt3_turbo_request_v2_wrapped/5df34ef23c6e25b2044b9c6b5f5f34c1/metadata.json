Each case has three packs of muffins. Each pack has four muffins. If she prices each muffin at two dollars, how many cases of muffins must she sell to raise enough money for the trip?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that each case has 3 packs of muffins, and each pack has 4 muffins. So, each case has a total of 12 muffins. If she sells each muffin for $2, then each case will bring in $24. To raise $120, she will need to sell 5 cases of muffins.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 5\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: A pack of dogs found a pile of bones in the dumpster behind the butcher shop. One by one, the dogs crawled into the dumpster, grabbed a mouthful of bones, and ran off with their newfound treasure. In all, there were 5 dogs. The first dog carried off 3 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog. The fourth dog carried off one bone, and the fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog carried, leaving no remaining bones in the dumpster. How many bones were in the original pile of bones?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog, so the fifth dog carried off 2 bones. The fourth dog carried off 1 bone. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog, so the third dog carried off 2 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog, so the second dog carried off 2 bones. Finally, the first dog carried off 3 bones. Adding all these up, we find that there were 10 bones in the original pile.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 10\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 5.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715214100.479701}
