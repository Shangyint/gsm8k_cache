If the old price of electricity was 12 cents per kilowatt-hour, how much does his computer cost, in dollars, to run for 50 hours?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the new wattage of John\\'s new computer by adding 50% more to 800 watts. Then we need to calculate the new price of electricity after the 25% increase. Finally, we can calculate the cost to run the computer for 50 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: $9.00\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 12.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715152132.5603468}
