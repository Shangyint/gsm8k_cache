What is their combined weight in pounds?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: Answer: ${calculate the weight of the donkey and then add it to the weight of the elephant to find the total weight in pounds.}\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: First, we need to find the weight of the donkey. Since the elephant weighs 3 tons (3 * 2000 = 6000 pounds), the donkey weighs 90% less, which means it weighs 10% of the elephant\\'s weight. So, the weight of the donkey is 10% of 6000 pounds, which is 600 pounds. Therefore, the combined weight of the donkey and the elephant is 6000 + 600 = 6600 pounds.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your reasoning should contain 3.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150886.790883}
