He has a grove that is 50 trees by 30 trees. How many lemons does he produce in 5 years?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many lemons one tree produces in a year with the 50% increase. Then we can find out how many lemons Jim\\'s grove produces in a year. Finally, we can multiply that by 5 to find out how many lemons he produces in 5 years.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jim\\'s specially engineered lemon trees produce 90 lemons per year. Therefore, his grove produces 50 trees * 30 trees * 90 lemons = 135,000 lemons per year. In 5 years, he produces 135,000 lemons/year * 5 years = 675,000 lemons.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: rationale should contain 60\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715150393.753705}
