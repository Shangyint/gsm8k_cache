When the pups grow up, all the mice have another 6 pups. Then each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups due to the stress of overcrowding. How many mice are left?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We start with 8 adult mice, who each have 6 pups, so that\\'s 8 * 6 = 48 pups. When the pups grow up, they also have 6 pups each, so that\\'s 48 * 6 = 288 pups. Adding the adult mice, we have a total of 8 + 288 = 296 mice. However, each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups, so that\\'s 8 * 2 = 16 pups eaten. Therefore, the total number of mice left is 296 - 16 = 280.\\\\nAnswer: 280\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Georgina owns a parrot and is teaching it to speak.
