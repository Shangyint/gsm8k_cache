The pond can hold 200 gallons of water. Jerry\\'s hose can normally pump 6 gallons/minute, but due to drought restrictions, it can only pump 2/3rds as fast right now. How many minutes will it take Jerry to fill his pond?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. First, we need to calculate how fast the hose can pump water during the drought. Since the hose can only pump 2/3rds as fast, we need to multiply the normal rate by 2/3. This gives us a pumping rate of 4 gallons/minute. Then, we can divide the total amount of water needed to fill the pond, which is 200 gallons, by the rate at which the hose can pump water to find out how many minutes it will take.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 50 minutes\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 200.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 6.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218001.5251899}
