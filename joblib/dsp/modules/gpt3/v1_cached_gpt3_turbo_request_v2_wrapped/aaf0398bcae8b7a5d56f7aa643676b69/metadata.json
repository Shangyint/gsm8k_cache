How many pages does the first chapter have?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that each chapter has three pages more than the previous one. So, if we let x be the number of pages in the first chapter, the second chapter will have x + 3 pages, the third chapter will have x + 6 pages, and so on. Since there are five chapters in total, we can set up the equation x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + (x + 9) + (x + 12) = 95 to represent the total number of pages in the book.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The first chapter has 13 pages.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715216628.867566}
