If he has 4 barrels and a cask stores 20 gallons, how much water can he store?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that a cask stores 20 gallons, so twice as much as a cask would be 20 * 2 = 40 gallons. Adding 3 more gallons to that gives us 40 + 3 = 43 gallons per barrel. Since James has 4 barrels, he can store 4 * 43 = 172 gallons of water in the barrels. Adding the 20 gallons from the cask, James can store a total of 172 + 20 = 192 gallons of water.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: James can store 192 gallons of water.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715215546.610834}
