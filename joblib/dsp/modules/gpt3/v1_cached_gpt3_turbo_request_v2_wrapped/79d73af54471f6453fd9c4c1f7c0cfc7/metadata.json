Each case has three packs of muffins. Each pack has four muffins. If she prices each muffin at two dollars, how many cases of muffins must she sell to raise enough money for the trip?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that each case has 3 packs of muffins, and each pack has 4 muffins. So, each case has a total of 12 muffins. If she sells each muffin for $2, then each case will bring in $24. To raise $120, she will need to sell 5 cases of muffins.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 5\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Biff and Kenneth decide to compete in a 500-yard rowboat race.
