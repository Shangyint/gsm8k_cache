Spruces make up 10% of all the trees, and pines 13%. There are as many oaks as spruces and pines put together. How many birches are there in the forest?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that spruces make up 10% and pines make up 13% of the total trees, which means spruces = 0.10 * 4000 = 400 trees and pines = 0.13 * 4000 = 520 trees. Since there are as many oaks as spruces and pines put together, oaks = 400 + 520 = 920 trees. This leaves us with 4000 - 400 - 520 - 920 = 2160 birch trees in the forest.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: There are 2160 birch trees in the forest.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715218284.5750232}
