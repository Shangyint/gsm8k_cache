If Darryl has 20 books, calculate the total number of books the three have.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Darryl has 20 books. Lamont has twice the number of books Darryl has, so Lamont has 20 x 2 = 40 books. Loris needs three more books to have the same number as Lamont, so Loris has 40 + 3 = 43 books. To find the total number of books the three have, we add up 20 (Darryl) + 40 (Lamont) + 43 (Loris) = 103.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The total number of books the three have is 103.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295081.362126}
