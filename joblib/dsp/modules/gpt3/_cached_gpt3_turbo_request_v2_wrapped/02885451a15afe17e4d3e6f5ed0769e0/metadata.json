How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by setting up a system of equations to represent the information given. Since each tripodasaurus has three legs and one head, we can let x be the number of tripodasauruses in the flock. This means that the total number of legs would be 3x and the total number of heads would be x. We know that the total number of heads and legs is 20, so we can set up the equation 3x + x = 20.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Solving the equation, we get 4x = 20, which means x = 5. Therefore, there are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293307.069908}
