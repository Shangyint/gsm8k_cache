Two-thirds of the people who buy a ticket will buy deep-fried fair food for $8, one quarter will go on a ride for $4, and one eighth will spend $15 on a souvenir. The fair made $2520 from tickets. How many dollars did they make in all?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by calculating how much money the fair made from each additional purchase (food, ride, souvenir). Then we can use the information given about the percentage of people making each purchase to find out how much money was made from each. Finally, we can add up all the money made to find the total.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The fair made $2520 from tickets, so we can calculate the additional purchases made by 2/3 of people ($8), 1/4 of people ($4), and 1/8 of people ($15). This adds up to $1680. Adding this to the ticket sales, the fair made a total of $4200.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295129.741222}
