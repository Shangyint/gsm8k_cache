Daragh\\'s youngest sister, Eden, already had 10 stuffed bears. How many stuffed bears does Eden have now?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many bears Daragh had left after taking out her favorite 8 bears, which is 20 - 8 = 12 bears. Then we need to divide that number by 3 to find out how many bears each sister received, which is 12 / 3 = 4 bears per sister. Finally, we need to add the bears that Eden already had, which is 10 bears, to the number she received from Daragh, which is 4 bears. Therefore, Eden now has 10 + 4 = 14 stuffed bears.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Eden now has 14 stuffed bears.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294821.239279}
