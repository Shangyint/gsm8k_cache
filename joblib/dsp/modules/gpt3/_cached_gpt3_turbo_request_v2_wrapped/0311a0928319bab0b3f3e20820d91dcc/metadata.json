They bought 4 bags of Reese\\'s for $9 per bag, 3 bags of Snickers for $5 per bag, and 5 bags of Skittles for $7 per bag.

We need to calculate the total cost of the unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata and the treats separately, and then add them together. The unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata cost $13. The Reese\\'s cost 4 bags x $9 per bag = $36. The Snickers cost 3 bags x $5 per bag = $15. The Skittles cost 5 bags x $7 per bag = $35. Adding all these costs together, we get $13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $99.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The unicorn pi\\\\u00f1ata and treats cost altogether $99.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294653.090438}
