During her hike, she drinks 2 pounds of water per hour and eats 1/3rd the weight of food per hour as water per hour. How much weight is she carrying after six hours?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the weight of water and food Karen consumes during the hike, subtract that from the initial weight, and then add the weight of gear. Since Karen drinks 2 pounds of water per hour, after 6 hours she would have consumed 12 pounds of water (2 pounds/hour * 6 hours). She eats 1/3rd the weight of food per hour as water per hour, which means she eats 2/3 pounds of food per hour. After 6 hours, she would have consumed 4 pounds of food (2/3 pounds/hour * 6 hours). Therefore, the total weight she consumed is 12 pounds of water + 4 pounds of food = 16 pounds. Subtracting this from the initial weight of 50 pounds (20 pounds of water + 10 pounds of food + 20 pounds of gear), we get 50 pounds - 16 pounds = 34 pounds. Finally, adding the weight of gear back in, Karen is carrying 34 pounds + 20 pounds = 54 pounds after six hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Karen is carrying 54 pounds after six hours.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293108.184715}
