Question: Marcel goes to the store with Dale to buy groceries for cooking dinner. Marcel buys 10 ears of corn, and Dale buys half that amount. Dale buys 8 potatoes and Marcel buys some, too. If they check out together and end up buying 27 vegetables, how many potatoes did Marcel buy? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to determine the number of potatoes Marcel bought. First, we know that Dale bought half the amount of corn that Marcel bought, so Dale bought 5 ears of corn. Next, we know that Marcel and Dale bought a total of 10 + 5 = 15 ears of corn and 8 + x = 27 vegetables, where x represents the number of potatoes Marcel bought. Therefore, x = 27 - 15 = 12. Marcel bought 12 potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Marcel bought 12 potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295040.649892}
