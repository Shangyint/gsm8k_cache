During that time, Chris got sick for one week and Cathy took her shifts. If there are four weeks in a month, how many hours did Cathy work during the 2 months? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total number of hours Cathy worked. First, we find out how many hours Chris was supposed to work in total: 20 hours/week * 4 weeks/month * 2 months = 160 hours. Since Chris was sick for one week, he worked 160 hours - 20 hours = 140 hours. Since Cathy took Chris\\'s shifts, she worked 140 hours + 20 hours = 160 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Cathy worked 160 hours during the 2 months.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293249.7663202}
