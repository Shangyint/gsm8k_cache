During breakfast, they had 73 customers. During lunch, they had 127 customers. During dinner, they had 87 customers. If they predict they\\'ll get twice the amount of customers on Saturday as they had on Friday, how many customers do they predict they will get?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the total number of customers on Friday by adding up the customers during breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Then, we need to multiply that total by 2 to get the predicted number of customers on Saturday.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The total number of customers on Friday is 73 + 127 + 87 = 287. Therefore, they predict they will get 287 * 2 = 574 customers on Saturday.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 73.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294936.681277}
