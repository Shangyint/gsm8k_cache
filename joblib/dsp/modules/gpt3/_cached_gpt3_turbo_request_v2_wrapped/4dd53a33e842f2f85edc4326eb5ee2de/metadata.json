She wins $1 for every game she wins, $0 for every game she ties, and she loses $2 for every game she loses. If she played 100 games where she tied 40 of them, and she lost $30, how many games did she win?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: find out how many games Sarah won. We know that she lost $30, which means she lost $2 per game for 15 games. We also know that she tied 40 games, leaving 45 games unaccounted for. Let\\'s calculate how much money she won or lost from those 45 games. Since she wins $1 for every game she wins, we can set up the equation: 1 * x = total money won from games won. We know that she lost $30 and tied 40 games, so the total money lost from those games is 30 + (40 * 0) = $30. Therefore, the total money won from the 45 games she won is $30. So, x = 30 / 1 = 30 games won.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 30\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 100.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294814.046422}
