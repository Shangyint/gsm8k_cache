How much did he pay for everything? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total cost. First, we calculate the cost of the dirt bikes: 3 bikes * $150 = $450. Then, we calculate the cost of the off-road vehicles: 4 vehicles * $300 = $1200. Next, we calculate the registration cost for all vehicles: (3 bikes + 4 vehicles) * $25 = $175. Finally, we add up all the costs: $450 (dirt bikes) + $1200 (off-road vehicles) + $175 (registration) = $1825.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: James paid $1825 for everything.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294939.0605922}
