How many acorns do they have altogether?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many acorns Sheila has by multiplying Shawna\\'s acorns by 5, which is 7 x 5 = 35. Then we need to find out how many acorns Danny has by adding 3 to Sheila\\'s acorns, which is 35 + 3 = 38. Finally, we can add up all three amounts, Shawna\\'s 7 acorns, Sheila\\'s 35 acorns, and Danny\\'s 38 acorns, to find the total number of acorns, which is 7 + 35 + 38 = 80.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Altogether, Shawna, Sheila, and Danny have 80 acorns.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 7.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294978.924115}
