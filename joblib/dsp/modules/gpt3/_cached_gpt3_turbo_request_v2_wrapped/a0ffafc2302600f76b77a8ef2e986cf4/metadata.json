How many marbles do Albert and Allison have? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the total number of marbles Albert and Allison have. First, we know that Allison has 28 marbles. Angela has 8 more than Allison, so Angela has 28 + 8 = 36 marbles. Since Albert has three times as many marbles as Angela, Albert has 3 * 36 = 108 marbles. Therefore, Albert and Allison together have 108 + 28 = 136 marbles.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Albert and Allison have 136 marbles.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294875.388811}
