Each bag of soil has 4 cubic feet. How many bags of soil will she need?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the volume of each raised bed first. The formula for volume is length x width x height. So, for each raised bed, the volume would be 8 feet x 4 feet x 1 foot = 32 cubic feet. Since Abby is building 2 raised beds, the total volume needed would be 32 cubic feet x 2 = 64 cubic feet. Each bag of soil has 4 cubic feet, so to find out how many bags she needs, we divide the total volume by the volume of each bag: 64 cubic feet / 4 cubic feet = 16 bags of soil.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Abby will need 16 bags of soil.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294790.5240378}
