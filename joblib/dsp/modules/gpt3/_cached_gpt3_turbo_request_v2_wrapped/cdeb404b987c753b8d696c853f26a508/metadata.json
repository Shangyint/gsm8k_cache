This month, she worked for 160 hours and sold $25000 worth of items. Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings and the rest will be put towards insurance. How much did she allocate to insurance?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate Kristy\\'s total earnings for the month. This includes her basic salary and commission. Since she worked for 160 hours, her basic salary can be calculated as $7.50/hour * 160 hours = $1200. Her commission on sales worth $25000 is 16%, so it is $25000 * 0.16 = $4000. Therefore, her total earnings for the month are $1200 + $4000 = $5200. Next, we need to find out 95% of her total earnings to determine her budget for various expenses. 95% of $5200 is 0.95 * $5200 = $4940. Finally, we can subtract her budget from her total earnings to find out how much she allocated to insurance. $5200 - $4940 = $260. Therefore, Kristy allocated $260 towards insurance.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Kristy allocated $260 towards insurance.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 160.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293337.8540008}
