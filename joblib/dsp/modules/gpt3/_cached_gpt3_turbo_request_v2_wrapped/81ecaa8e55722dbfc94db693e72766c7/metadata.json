He has a grove that is 50 trees by 30 trees. How many lemons does he produce in 5 years?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many lemons one tree produces in a year with the 50% increase. Then we can find out how many lemons Jim\\'s grove produces in a year. Finally, we can multiply that by 5 to find out how many lemons he produces in 5 years.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Each tree produces 60 * 1.5 = 90 lemons per year. Jim\\'s grove produces 50 * 30 * 90 = 135,000 lemons per year. Therefore, in 5 years, Jim produces 135,000 * 5 = 675,000 lemons.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 60.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295025.481709}
