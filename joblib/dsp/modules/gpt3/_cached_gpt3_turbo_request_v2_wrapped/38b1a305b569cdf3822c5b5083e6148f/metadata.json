Her current job is 8 hours a week with a wage of $10 per hour. The new job is offering 4 hours a week with a wage of $15 per hour with an additional bonus of $35 per week if she exceeds her quota. Maisy is confident that she will exceed her quota and decides to include this when calculating her wage at the new job. How much more money, in dollars, will Maisy earn at her new job?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: Answer: calculate the total earnings at each job. Question: ${Maisy\\'s total earnings at her current job can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked per week by the wage per hour. This gives us 8 hours/week * $10/hour = $80/week. At the new job, Maisy will earn $15/hour for 4 hours/week, which totals $60/week. In addition, she will receive a bonus of $35/week if she exceeds her quota. Therefore, her total earnings at the new job will be $60/week + $35/week = $95/week. To find out how much more money Maisy will earn at her new job, we need to calculate the difference between her earnings at the new job and her earnings at her current job. This can be done by subtracting her current earnings from her new earnings: $95/week - $80/week = $15/week. Therefore, Maisy will earn $15 more per week at her new job compared to her current job.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Maisy will earn $15 more per week at her new job compared to her current job.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294916.930451}
