Ariella\\'s account earns her simple interest at the rate of 10% per annum. If Daniella has $400, how much money will Ariella have after two years? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate Ariella\\'s final amount after two years. First, we need to find out how much money Ariella has in her son\\'s savings account. Since she has $200 more than Daniella, Ariella has $400 + $200 = $600. Next, we need to calculate the interest earned by Ariella\\'s account after two years, which is 10% of $600 for each year. After two years, the total interest earned will be 10% * $600 * 2 = $120. Adding this interest to the initial amount, Ariella will have $600 + $120 = $720 after two years.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Ariella will have $720 after two years.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295083.45299}
