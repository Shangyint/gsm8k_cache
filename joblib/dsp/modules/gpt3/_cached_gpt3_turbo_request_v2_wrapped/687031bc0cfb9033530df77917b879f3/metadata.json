If she had one $50 bill, how much change did she receive? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total cost of the basketball cards and baseball cards. First, we multiply the cost of each pack of basketball cards by the number of packs Olivia bought: 2 packs * $3 = $6. Next, we multiply the cost of each deck of baseball cards by the number of decks Olivia bought: 5 decks * $4 = $20. Adding these two amounts together gives us the total cost: $6 + $20 = $26. Since Olivia paid with a $50 bill, we subtract the total cost from $50 to find the change: $50 - $26 = $24.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Olivia received $24 in change.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294885.5388641}
