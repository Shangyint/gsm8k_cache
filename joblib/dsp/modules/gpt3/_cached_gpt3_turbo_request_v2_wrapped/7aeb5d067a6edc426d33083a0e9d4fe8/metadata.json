He picks up a bottle of 50 pills and takes them home. He takes 2 pills each day three times a day for the first 2 days, before cutting this amount in half for the next 3 days. On the sixth day, he takes a final 2 pills in the morning and ends up feeling better. How many pills are left in the bottle?\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 50.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Tony takes a total of 2 pills three times a day for the first 2 days, which is a total of 6 pills per day. So, for the first 2 days, he takes 12 pills. Then, he cuts this amount in half for the next 3 days, so he takes 3 pills per day for the next 3 days, which is a total of 9 pills. So, for the first 5 days, he takes a total of 21 pills. On the sixth day, he takes 2 more pills, bringing the total to 23 pills. Since he started with 50 pills, there are 50 - 23 = 27 pills left in the bottle.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 27\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: A pack of dogs found a pile of bones in the dumpster behind the butcher shop. One by one, the dogs crawled into the dumpster, grabbed a mouthful of bones, and ran off with their newfound treasure. In all, there were 5 dogs. The first dog carried off 3 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog. The fourth dog carried off one bone, and the fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog carried, leaving no remaining bones in the dumpster. How many bones were in the original pile of bones?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the first dog carried off 3 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog, so it carried off 3 - 1 = 2 bones. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog, so it carried off 2 x 2 = 4 bones. The fourth dog carried off one bone. The fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog carried, so it carried off 2 x 1 = 2 bones. Adding up all the bones carried off by each dog, we get 3 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 12 bones. Therefore, there were 12 bones in the original pile of bones.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 12\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 5.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294040.44978}
