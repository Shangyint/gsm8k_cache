How much did he spend in total?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total cost of the tomatoes and the apples separately, and then add them together to find the total amount spent. First, we calculate the cost of the tomatoes by multiplying the number of pounds (2) by the cost per pound ($5). Then, we calculate the cost of the apples by multiplying the number of pounds (5) by the cost per pound ($6). Finally, we add the two costs together to find the total amount spent.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Mark spent $10 on tomatoes (2 pounds x $5 per pound = $10) and $30 on apples (5 pounds x $6 per pound = $30). Therefore, Mark spent a total of $40 ($10 + $30 = $40) on tomatoes and apples.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 2.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293136.457912}
