When Genevieve reached the checkout counter, she realized she was $400 short of the total price and her friend Clarice chipped in. If Genevieve had $1600 on her, how many kilograms of cherries did she buy?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by finding out how much money Genevieve needed in total for the cherries. Then we can subtract the $1600 she had from that total to find out how much she was short. Finally, we can divide that amount by the cost per kilogram to find out how many kilograms of cherries she bought.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Genevieve needed a total of $2000 for the cherries ($1600 she had + $400 she was short). Since the cherries cost $8 per kilogram, she bought 250 kilograms of cherries ( $2000 total cost / $8 cost per kilogram).\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294831.5131578}
