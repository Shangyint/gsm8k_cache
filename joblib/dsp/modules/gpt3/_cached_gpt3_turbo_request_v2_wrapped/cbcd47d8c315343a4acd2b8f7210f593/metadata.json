The first week, he followed a cake recipe that called for 24 cups of sugar. Each week after that, he reduced the amount of sugar by half. How much sugar did he use for the cake on the fourth week? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the answer. In the first week, Paul used 24 cups of sugar. In the second week, he used half of that amount, which is 24/2 = 12 cups. In the third week, he used half of the amount from the second week, which is 12/2 = 6 cups. Therefore, in the fourth week, he would use half of the amount from the third week, which is 6/2 = 3 cups of sugar.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Paul used 3 cups of sugar for the cake on the fourth week.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294890.718876}
