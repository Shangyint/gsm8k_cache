Dale buys 8 potatoes and Marcel buys some, too. If they check out together and end up buying 27 vegetables, how many potatoes did Marcel buy?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Marcel bought 10 ears of corn and Dale bought half that amount, which is 5 ears of corn. This means they bought a total of 10 + 5 = 15 ears of corn. Since they bought 27 vegetables in total, and 15 of those were ears of corn, the remaining 27 - 15 = 12 vegetables must be potatoes. Therefore, Marcel bought 12 potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 12\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 8.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295042.411238}
