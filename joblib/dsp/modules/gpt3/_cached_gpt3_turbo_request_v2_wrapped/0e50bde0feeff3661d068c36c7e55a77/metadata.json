He has a grove that is 50 trees by 30 trees. How many lemons does he produce in 5 years?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many lemons one tree produces in a year with the 50% increase. Since a normal lemon tree produces 60 lemons per year, Jim\\'s specially engineered lemon trees produce 60 * 1.5 = 90 lemons per year. Next, we can find out how many lemons Jim\\'s grove produces in a year by multiplying the number of trees in the grove (50 * 30) by the number of lemons each tree produces (90). This gives us 50 * 30 * 90 = 135,000 lemons per year. Finally, to find out how many lemons Jim produces in 5 years, we can multiply the annual production by 5, giving us 135,000 * 5 = 675,000 lemons.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jim produces 675,000 lemons in 5 years.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 60.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295028.796818}
