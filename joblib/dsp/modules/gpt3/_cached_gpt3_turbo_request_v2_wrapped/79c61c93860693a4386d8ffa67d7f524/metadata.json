One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the total number of customers each woman served individually by multiplying the number of hours worked by the number of customers served per hour. Ann and Becky worked for 8 hours each, serving 56 customers each (8 hours * 7 customers per hour). Julia worked for 6 hours, serving 42 customers (6 hours * 7 customers per hour). To find the total number of customers served by all three women, we need to add up the individual totals.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Ann served 56 customers, Becky served 56 customers, and Julia served 42 customers. Therefore, all three women served a total of 154 customers that day (56 + 56 + 42).\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 8.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294998.247618}
