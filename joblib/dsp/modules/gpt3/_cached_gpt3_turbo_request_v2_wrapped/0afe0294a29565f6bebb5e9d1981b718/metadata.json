The other team, The Spiders, scored half the amount that The Kickers scored in the first period and twice the amount that The Kickers scored in their second period. What is the total amount of goals both teams scored?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many goals The Kickers scored in the second period, which is 2 goals x 2 = 4 goals. Then, we calculate how many goals The Spiders scored in the first period, which is 2 goals / 2 = 1 goal. Finally, we calculate how many goals The Spiders scored in the second period, which is 4 goals x 2 = 8 goals. Adding up all the goals scored by both teams, we get 2 + 4 + 1 + 8 = 15 goals.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The total amount of goals both teams scored is 15 goals.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295008.212306}
