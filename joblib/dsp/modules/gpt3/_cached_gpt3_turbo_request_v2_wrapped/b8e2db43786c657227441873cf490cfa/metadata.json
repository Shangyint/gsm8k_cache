If the old price of electricity was 12 cents per kilowatt-hour, how much does his computer cost, in dollars, to run for 50 hours?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the new wattage of John\\'s new computer. Since it uses 50% more power than his old computer, we need to add 50% of 800 watts to 800 watts. This gives us 800 + 0.5(800) = 1200 watts. Next, we need to calculate the new price of electricity after the 25% increase. The new price is 12 cents + 0.25(12 cents) = 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. Finally, we can calculate the cost to run John\\'s new computer for 50 hours by multiplying the wattage, hours, and price per kilowatt-hour.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The cost to run John\\'s new computer for 50 hours is 1200 watts * 50 hours * 0.15 dollars per kilowatt-hour = $90.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294911.9521909}
