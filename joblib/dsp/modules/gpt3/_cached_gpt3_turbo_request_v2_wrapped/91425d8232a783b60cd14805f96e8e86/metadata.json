He found 12 cans at home and three times as many at his grandparents\\' house. His neighbor gave him 46. His dad brought home 250 cans from the office. His dad told him he could keep the money from the cans he brought home from the office if he promised to put half of his entire amount collected into savings. How much money would Collin have to put into savings?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to first calculate the total number of cans Collin collected. He found 12 cans at home, three times as many at his grandparents\\' house (12 x 3 = 36 cans), his neighbor gave him 46 cans, and his dad brought home 250 cans from the office. So, the total number of cans is 12 + 36 + 46 + 250 = 344 cans. Next, we need to calculate how much money Collin would earn from these cans. Since he earns $0.25 per can, he would earn 344 x $0.25 = $86 from all the cans. If his dad told him to put half of his entire amount collected into savings, Collin would have to put $86 / 2 = $43 into savings.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Collin would have to put $43 into savings.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294761.282921}
