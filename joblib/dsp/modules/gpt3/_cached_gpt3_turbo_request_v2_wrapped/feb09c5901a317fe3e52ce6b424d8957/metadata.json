In hours, how long will it take for the rabbit to catch up?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that the cat has a head start of 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.25 hours (15 minutes / 60 minutes). In that time, the cat will have traveled 20 miles per hour * 0.25 hours = 5 miles. Now, the rabbit needs to catch up 5 miles. The rabbit runs 5 miles per hour faster than the cat, so it will catch up at a rate of 25 miles per hour - 20 miles per hour = 5 miles per hour. Therefore, it will take the rabbit 5 miles / 5 miles per hour = 1 hour to catch up.\\\\nAnswer: 1\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Mark is baking bread. He has to let it rise for 120 minutes twice.

Jeopardy is 20 minutes and Wheel of Fortune is twice as long. How many hours did he watch TV?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that James watched 2 episodes of Jeopardy, each 20 minutes long, so that\\'s 40 minutes total. He also watched 2 episodes of Wheel of Fortune, each twice as long as Jeopardy, so 40 minutes x 2 = 80 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (minutes in an hour), so 40 minutes + 80 minutes = 120 minutes total. 120 minutes \\\\u00f7 60 = 2 hours.\\\\nAnswer: 2\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Bob, Tom, Sally, and Jerry had dinner at their favorite pizzeria.
