We know that in seven years, Talia will be 20 years old. So, currently, Talia is 20 - 7 = 13 years old. Talia\\'s mom is currently three times as old as Talia is today, which means her mom is 3 * 13 = 39 years old. In three years, Talia\\'s father will be the same age as Talia\\'s mom is today, so in three years, Talia\\'s father will be 39 years old. Therefore, currently, Talia\\'s father is 39 - 3 = 36 years old.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Talia\\'s father is currently 36 years old.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295116.484239}
