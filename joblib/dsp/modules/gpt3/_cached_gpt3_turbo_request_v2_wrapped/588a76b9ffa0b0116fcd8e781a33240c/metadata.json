We know that there are 290 liters of oil in total and 10 cans are holding 8 liters each, which means a total of 80 liters are accounted for. To find out how much oil is in each of the remaining cans, we can subtract 80 from 290 to get the remaining amount of oil. Then, we divide that amount by the number of remaining cans to find out how much oil each can is holding.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Each of the remaining cans is holding 21 liters of oil.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 290.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 24.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293283.190905}
