She wears one shirt to school for each of the five weekdays. Three days a week, she changes into a different shirt for an after-school club. On Saturday, she wears one shirt all day. On Sunday, she wears a different shirt to church than she does for the rest of the day. How many shirts does she need to be able to only do laundry once every two weeks?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total number of shirts Kendra wears in a two-week period and then add a buffer for any unexpected circumstances.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Kendra wears 5 shirts for school each week, 3 extra shirts for after-school clubs, 1 shirt on Saturday, and 2 different shirts on Sunday. This adds up to a total of 5 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 11 shirts per week. In a two-week period, she would need 11 shirts x 2 weeks = 22 shirts. To add a buffer for unexpected circumstances, Kendra should have at least 24 shirts to only do laundry once every two weeks.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294868.914069}
