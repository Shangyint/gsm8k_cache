If the pie left in the fridge weighs 1200 grams, how many grams did Sophia eat?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Sophia ate 1/6 of the pie and put the rest in the fridge. This means that 5/6 of the pie is in the fridge. If the weight of the pie in the fridge is 1200 grams, we can find out the weight of the whole pie and then calculate how many grams Sophia ate.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Sophia ate 1/6 of the pie, so the weight of the whole pie is 1200 grams / (5/6) = 1440 grams. Sophia ate 1/6 of the pie, which is 1440 grams / 6 = 240 grams. Sophia ate 240 grams of pie.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294797.6848571}
