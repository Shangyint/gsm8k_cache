If the number of students in Middle school is 50, calculate the total number of students in both levels.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find the number of students in Elementary School by multiplying 4 by the number of students in Middle School and then subtracting 3. So, 4 * 50 - 3 = 197 students in Elementary School. To find the total number of students in both levels, we add the number of students in Middle School and Elementary School together. Therefore, 50 (Middle School) + 197 (Elementary School) = 247 total students.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 247 students\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294879.8687701}
