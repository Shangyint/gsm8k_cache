She picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked and her parents picked 93 strawberries less than her. If her brother picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, how many strawberries would they each have if they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many strawberries Kimberly picked and how many her parents picked. Then we can add up all the strawberries picked and divide them equally among the family members.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Kimberly picked 3 baskets x 15 strawberries/basket = 45 strawberries. Her brother picked 3 baskets x 15 strawberries/basket = 45 strawberries. Kimberly picked 8 x 45 strawberries = 360 strawberries. Her parents picked 360 strawberries - 93 strawberries = 267 strawberries. In total, they picked 360 strawberries + 45 strawberries + 45 strawberries + 267 strawberries = 717 strawberries. If they divide the strawberries equally, each family member would have 717 strawberries / 4 = 179.25 strawberries.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 8.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293328.3579211}
