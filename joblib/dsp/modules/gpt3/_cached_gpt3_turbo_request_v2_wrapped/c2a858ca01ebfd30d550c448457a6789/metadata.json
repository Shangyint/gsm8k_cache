Her sister follows in a sailboat that has a speed of 12 miles per hour. If the lake is 60 miles wide, how long does Janet have to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the time it takes for Janet\\'s sister to catch up. We can start by finding the time it takes for Janet to cross the lake, which is distance divided by speed. Then, we can use this time to calculate how far Janet\\'s sister has traveled in that time and how much longer it will take for her to catch up.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Janet will have to wait for 3 hours for her sister to catch up.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293295.8716931}
