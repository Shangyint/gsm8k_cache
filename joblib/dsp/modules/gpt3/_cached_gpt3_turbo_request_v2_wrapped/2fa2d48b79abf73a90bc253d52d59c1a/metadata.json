From Hidden Lake, he has to walk back to the Park Office and it takes him 7 minutes. When he arrives there, he will have been gone from the Park Office 32 minutes altogether. If he had walked to the Lake Park restaurant from the Park office before taking the 15 minute walk to Hidden Lake, how long is the walk from Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Dante takes 15 minutes to walk to Hidden Lake and 7 minutes to walk back to the Park Office. This means that the total time spent walking to and from Hidden Lake is 15 + 7 = 22 minutes.
