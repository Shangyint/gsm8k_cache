We will first calculate the height of the second and third trees, then find the average height of all the trees.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The second tree was 500 feet tall (half of 1000 feet), the third tree was 1200 feet tall (1000 + 200). The average height of all the trees Jackie climbed is (1000 + 500 + 500 + 1200) / 4 = 800 feet.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 1000.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293188.572625}
