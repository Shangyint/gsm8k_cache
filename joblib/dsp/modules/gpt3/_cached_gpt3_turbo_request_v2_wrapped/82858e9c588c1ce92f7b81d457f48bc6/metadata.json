If Sally makes $6 per day and Bob makes $4 per day, how much money will they both have saved for their trip after a year?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how much Sally and Bob earn in a year by working as babysitters. Sally earns $6 per day, so in a year (365 days), she will earn $6 * 365 = $2190. Bob earns $4 per day, so in a year, he will earn $4 * 365 = $1460. Together, they will have saved half of their earnings for the trip, so Sally will save $2190 / 2 = $1095 and Bob will save $1460 / 2 = $730.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Sally will have saved $1095 and Bob will have saved $730 for their trip after a year.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294765.668266}
