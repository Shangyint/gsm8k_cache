The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, and there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. What is the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We will first calculate the number of snakes, which is 3 times the number of parrots, so 3 * 8 = 24 snakes. Next, we find the number of monkeys, which is 2 times the number of snakes, so 2 * 24 = 48 monkeys. Then, we calculate the number of elephants, which is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, so (8 + 24) / 2 = 16 elephants. Finally, we determine the number of zebras, which is 3 fewer than the number of elephants, so 16 - 3 = 13 zebras. Now, we find the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys, which is 48 - 13 = 35.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys is 35.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 8.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293255.6355999}
