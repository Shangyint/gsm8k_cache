We first need to find out how many blueberries Mason used in total for the blueberry muffins. Since he has 3 cartons of 200 blueberries each, he has a total of 3 * 200 = 600 blueberries. If he makes as many muffins as he can with 10 blueberries per muffin, he can make a total of 600 / 10 = 60 blueberry muffins. Adding the 60 cinnamon muffins, Mason made a total of 60 + 60 = 120 muffins. To find the percentage of muffins that have blueberries, we divide the number of blueberry muffins by the total number of muffins and multiply by 100.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 50% of all the muffins Mason made have blueberries.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294992.1092322}
