The recipe he is following calls for 2 ounces of butter for every 1 cup of baking mix; however, it allows 2 ounces of coconut oil to be substituted for the 2 ounces of butter if necessary. The chef would like to use as much butter as possible before switching over and substituting coconut oil. If the chef had 4 ounces of butter remaining, and he plans on using 6 cups of baking mix, how many ounces of coconut oil will he end up using?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Answer: determine how much butter the chef can use before switching to coconut oil. First, we need to find out how many ounces of butter are needed for 6 cups of baking mix. Since the recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for every 1 cup of baking mix, for 6 cups of baking mix, the chef would need 2 * 6 = 12 ounces of butter. Since the chef only has 4 ounces of butter remaining, he can only use 4 ounces of butter. This means he will need to substitute the remaining 8 ounces with coconut oil. Therefore, the chef will end up using 8 ounces of coconut oil.\\\\nAnswer:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294589.821198}
