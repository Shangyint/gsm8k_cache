There are 10 students in the class, 5 of which scored a 92 on the test and 4 of which scored an 80. What would the last student have to score to at least make the teacher happy?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: Answer: The last student would have to score a 100 in order to make the class average test score at least 85. Reasoning: The total score needed for the class to average 85 is 850 (85 * 10). The total score of the 9 students who have already taken the test is 732 (5 * 92 + 4 * 80). Therefore, the last student would need to score 118 (850 - 732) in order to reach the desired class average.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The last student would have to score a 100 in order to make the class average test score at least 85.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293204.737491}
