One by one, the dogs crawled into the dumpster, grabbed a mouthful of bones, and ran off with their newfound treasure. In all, there were 5 dogs. The first dog carried off 3 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog. The fourth dog carried off one bone, and the fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog carried, leaving no remaining bones in the dumpster. How many bones were in the original pile of bones?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by setting up two equations based on the number of heads and legs. Let\\'s denote the number of chickens as C and the number of goats as G. Since each animal has one head, we have C + G = 22. Additionally, since chickens have 2 legs and goats have 4 legs, we have 2C + 4G = 56. Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of C and G.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The farmer has 10 chickens and 12 goats.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 5.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 3.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293162.239636}
