In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that there were 24 players in total. In the first half, 11 players started the game and 2 substitutions were made, so a total of 13 players played in the first half. This means that 24 - 13 = 11 players did not play in the first half. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as in the first half, so 2 x 2 = 4 substitutions were made. This means that a total of 11 (players who did not play in the first half) + 4 (substitutions in the second half) = 15 players did not play in the second half. Therefore, the total number of players who did not play that day is 11 (did not play in the first half) + 15 (did not play in the second half) = 26 players.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 11 players on the team did not play that day.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295051.927586}
