How much change will he get from $350 if each liter of fuel costs $3?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to first calculate how many liters of fuel Donny needs to fill up his tank by subtracting the current amount of fuel from the total capacity. Donny\\'s truck can hold 150 liters, and it already has 38 liters, so he needs 112 liters more to fill it up (150 - 38 = 112). Then, we can multiply the number of liters needed by the cost per liter to find the total cost. 112 liters x $3 per liter = $336. Finally, we can subtract the total cost from the amount Donny paid to determine the change he will get back. $350 - $336 = $14.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Donny will get $14 in change from $350 after filling up his truck with 112 liters of fuel.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 150.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294848.914712}
