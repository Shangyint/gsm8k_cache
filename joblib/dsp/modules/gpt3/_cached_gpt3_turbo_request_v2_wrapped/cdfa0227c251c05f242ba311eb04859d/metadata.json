He sells them for $20 each and uses 3/5 of the sales to buy ingredients to make meat pies for sale on the next day. How much money does Du Chin remain with after setting aside the money for buying ingredients?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Answer: $2400 Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total sales Du Chin makes in a day. Since he sells each meat pie for $20 and bakes 200 meat pies, his total sales would be 200 * $20 = $4000. Next, we need to find out how much money he uses to buy ingredients for the next day. Since he uses 3/5 of the sales, he would use 3/5 * $4000 = $2400. Finally, to find out how much money Du Chin remains with after setting aside the money for buying ingredients, we subtract the amount used for ingredients from the total sales: $4000 - $2400 = $1600. Therefore, Du Chin remains with $1600 after setting aside the money for buying ingredients.\\\\nAnswer:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294594.767207}
