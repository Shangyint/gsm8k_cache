This season, half his races happened in lakes and half his races happened in the ocean. He had ten total races, each of which was 3 miles long. How much time did he spend in his races?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can calculate the total time spent in lake races and ocean races separately, and then add them together to find the total time spent in all races.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Tyson spent a total of 10 hours racing. In lake races, he spent 5 races x 3 miles/race = 15 miles. At a speed of 3 mph, he spent 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours in lake races. In ocean races, he spent 5 races x 3 miles/race = 15 miles. At a speed of 2.5 mph, he spent 15 miles / 2.5 mph = 6 hours in ocean races. Therefore, Tyson spent a total of 5 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours racing.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 3.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294627.785202}
