Each large box takes 4 feet of packing tape to seal, each medium box takes 2 feet of packing tape to seal, and each small box takes 1 foot of packing tape to seal. Each box also takes 1 foot of packing tape to stick the address label on. Debbie packed two large boxes, eight medium boxes, and five small boxes this afternoon. How much tape did she use?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Answer: 37 Question: ${question} Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total amount of tape used. First, we calculate the tape used for the large boxes: 2 large boxes * 4 feet per box = 8 feet. Next, we calculate the tape used for the medium boxes: 8 medium boxes * 2 feet per box = 16 feet. Then, we calculate the tape used for the small boxes: 5 small boxes * 1 foot per box = 5 feet. Finally, we add the tape used for the address labels: 15 boxes * 1 foot per box = 15 feet. Adding all these up, we get 8 + 16 + 5 + 15 = 44 feet.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 44\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: John plays a game for 4 hours a day every day for 2 weeks. After all that time, he is only 40% done. He increased his playtime to 7 hours a day. How long until he finishes the game?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: Answer: 1 week\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: John plays a game for 4 hours a day every day for 2 weeks, which is a total of 4 hours/day * 7 days/week * 2 weeks = 56 hours. Since he is only 40% done after this time, the total game time is 56 hours / 0.4 = 140 hours. After increasing his playtime to 7 hours a day, he plays 7 hours/day * 7 days/week = 49 hours per week. To finish the game, he needs 140 total hours - 56 hours already played = 84 hours. Therefore, it will take him 84 hours / 49 hours/week = 1.71 weeks, which can be rounded to 1 week.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 4.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293964.469161}
