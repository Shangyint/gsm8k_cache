Each large box takes 4 feet of packing tape to seal, each medium box takes 2 feet of packing tape to seal, and each small box takes 1 foot of packing tape to seal. Each box also takes 1 foot of packing tape to stick the address label on. Debbie packed two large boxes, eight medium boxes, and five small boxes this afternoon. How much tape did she use?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Answer: 37 Question: ${question} Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total amount of tape used. First, we calculate the tape used for the large boxes: 2 large boxes * 4 feet per box = 8 feet. Next, we calculate the tape used for the medium boxes: 8 medium boxes * 2 feet per box = 16 feet. Then, we calculate the tape used for the small boxes: 5 small boxes * 1 foot per box = 5 feet. Finally, we add the tape used for the address labels: 15 boxes * 1 foot per box = 15 feet. Adding all these up, we get 8 + 16 + 5 + 15 = 44 feet.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 44\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: It takes Jason 30 minutes to cut 1 lawn in his neighborhood.

First, we calculate the time spent cutting grass on Saturday: 8 lawns * 30 minutes per lawn = 240 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours. Next, we calculate the time spent cutting grass on Sunday: another 4 hours. Adding the time spent on both days, we get 4 + 4 = 8 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 8\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 1.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293955.3017862}
