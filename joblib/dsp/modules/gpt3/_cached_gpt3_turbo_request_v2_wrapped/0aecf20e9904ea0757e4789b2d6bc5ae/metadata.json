If Jeanine gave one third of his pencils to Abby, how many more pencils than Clare does Jeanine have now? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the answer. First, we need to determine how many pencils Clare bought, which is half of what Jeanine bought, so Clare bought 18 / 2 = 9 pencils. Next, Jeanine gave 1/3 of his pencils to Abby, which is 18 / 3 = 6 pencils. After giving pencils to Abby, Jeanine has 18 - 6 = 12 pencils left. Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of pencils Jeanine has and the number Clare has, which is 12 - 9 = 3 pencils.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jeanine has 3 more pencils than Clare now.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294915.7860239}
