A couple of hours later, 7 packages arrived from the second butcher. Finally, the third butcher\\\\u2019s delivery arrived at dusk. If all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers weighed 100 pounds, how many packages did the third butcher deliver?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the first butcher delivered 10 packages and the second butcher delivered 7 packages. Let\\'s represent the number of packages delivered by the third butcher as x. Since each package weighs 4 pounds, the total weight of ground beef delivered by the first butcher is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds, and the total weight delivered by the second butcher is 7 * 4 = 28 pounds. The total weight delivered by the third butcher is 100 - 40 - 28 = 32 pounds. Since each package weighs 4 pounds, the number of packages delivered by the third butcher is 32 / 4 = 8 packages.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The third butcher delivered 8 packages.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293168.510947}
