If there are 90 ducks total, how many Muscovies are there?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: find the answer. First, let\\'s represent the number of Khaki Campbells as x. Then, the number of Cayugas would be 2x + 3. Finally, the number of Muscovy ducks would be 2x + 3 + 4. Since the total number of ducks is 90, we can create an equation: x + 2x + 3 + 2x + 3 + 4 = 90. Solving this equation will give us the number of Muscovy ducks.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 33 Muscovy ducks\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293325.697228}
