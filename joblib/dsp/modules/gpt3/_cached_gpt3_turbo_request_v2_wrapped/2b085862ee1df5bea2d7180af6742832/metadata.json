He has an 8 cup bag of flour and realizes it would be faster to measure the flour he doesn\\'t need, take it out of the bag, and then dump the rest of the bag into the bowl. How many scoops should he remove?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Michael needs 6 cups of flour and he has an 8 cup bag of flour. If he uses the 1/4 cup measuring cup, he would need to remove the excess flour in order to get the correct amount. Since 1 cup is equal to 4 of the 1/4 cup scoops, we can calculate the number of scoops he needs to remove.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Michael should remove 2 cups of flour.
