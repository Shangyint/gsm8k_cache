We know that the total cost of the purchase is $55. We also know that the price of a tray of jumbo shrimp is $5. Additionally, we know that a pack of chewing gum costs half as much as a pint of frozen yogurt. Let\\'s denote the price of a pint of frozen yogurt as x. Therefore, the total cost can be represented as 5x (for the 5 pints of frozen yogurt) + 2(x/2) (for the 2 packs of chewing gum) + 5(5) (for the 5 trays of jumbo shrimp) = $55. Solving this equation will give us the price of a pint of frozen yogurt.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The price of a pint of frozen yogurt is $5.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293213.248857}
