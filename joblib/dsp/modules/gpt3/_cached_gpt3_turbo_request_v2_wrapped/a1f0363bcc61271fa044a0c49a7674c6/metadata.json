Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the wages for 19 workers for 5 days. First, we find the daily wage of one worker by dividing the total wages by the number of workers and days worked: $9450 / (15 workers * 6 days) = $105 per worker per day. Then, we can calculate the total wages for 19 workers for 5 days by multiplying the daily wage by the number of workers and days: $105 * (19 workers * 5 days) = $9975.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The wages for 19 workers for 5 days would be $9975.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293353.0713758}
