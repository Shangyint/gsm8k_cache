One balloon needs 50cm\\\\u00b3 to float high enough to touch the ceiling, and she can fill any remaining balloon with ordinary air. If she used up all of the helium and inflated every balloon, how many more balloons are touching the ceiling than not?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many balloons can be filled with the helium purchased. Since one balloon needs 50cm\\\\u00b3 of helium to float high enough to touch the ceiling, we can divide the total amount of helium (1800cm\\\\u00b3) by 50 to find out how many balloons can be filled with helium. Then, we can determine how many balloons will touch the ceiling with the helium. Finally, we can subtract the number of balloons touching the ceiling from the total number of balloons to find out how many more balloons are touching the ceiling than not.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 36 more balloons are touching the ceiling than not.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 50.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294806.0229802}
