He earned 20 points for each of the 3 exams he wrote but lost 5 points during the school year for bad behavior. How many more points can Jimmy lose and still be able to pass the next class?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total points Jimmy earned first. Since he earned 20 points for each of the 3 exams, his total exam points are 20 * 3 = 60 points. Then we need to subtract the points he lost for bad behavior, which is 5 points. So, Jimmy\\'s total points are 60 - 5 = 55 points. Since he needs at least 50 points to pass, he can lose a maximum of 55 - 50 = 5 more points and still be able to pass.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jimmy can lose a maximum of 5 more points and still be able to pass to the next class.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294619.799055}
