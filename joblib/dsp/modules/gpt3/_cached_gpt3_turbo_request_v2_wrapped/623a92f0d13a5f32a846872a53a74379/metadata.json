Ella got 4 incorrect answers while Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. What is Marion\\'s score? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find Marion\\'s score. First, we need to determine how many correct answers Ella got. Since there are 40 items and she got 4 incorrect, then she got 40 - 4 = 36 correct answers. Next, we find half of Ella\\'s score which is 36 / 2 = 18. Finally, we add 6 to this to get Marion\\'s score.\\\\nAnswer: 24\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. The total number of shooting stars counted by all three is 14 + 12 + 16 = 42. The average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them is 42 / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\\\\nAnswer: 2\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday, totaling 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 18 * 3 = 54 pencils. Therefore, Sarah has a total of 38 + 54 = 92 pencils.\\\\nAnswer: 92\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: There were 8000 jelly beans in a certain barrel, and 10 people lined up to take some.
