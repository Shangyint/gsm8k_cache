Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, and 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys. How many Buicks does Jim have?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: find the answer. Let\\'s denote the number of Chevys as x. Then the number of Fords would be 2x + 3, and the number of Buicks would be 4(2x + 3). The total number of cars is the sum of these three: x + 2x + 3 + 4(2x + 3) = 301. Solving this equation will give us the number of Buicks.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jim has 128 Buicks.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293357.0573592}
