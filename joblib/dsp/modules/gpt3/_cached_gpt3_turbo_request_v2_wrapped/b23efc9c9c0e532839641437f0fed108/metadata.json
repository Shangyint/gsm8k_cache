He got an 80, a 75 and a 90 on his first three tests. If he wants an 85 average for the class, what is the minimum grade he needs to get on his last test? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to determine the minimum grade Carl needs on his last test. First, we need to find the total points Carl has earned so far. He got 80 + 75 + 90 = 245 points out of a possible 300. To achieve an 85 average, he needs a total of 85 x 4 = 340 points. Therefore, he needs to get 340 - 245 = 95 points on his last test.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Carl needs to get a minimum grade of 95 on his last test to achieve an 85 average for the class.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295091.3149781}
