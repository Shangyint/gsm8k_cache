Rottweilers take 20 minutes to groom, border collies take 10 minutes to groom, and chihuahuas take 45 minutes to groom because they ferociously resist. How many minutes will it take Karen to groom 6 Rottweilers, 9 border collies and 1 chihuahua?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We will first calculate the total time it takes to groom all the Rottweilers, then all the border collies, and finally the chihuahua. After that, we will add up all the times to find the total grooming time. Since there are 6 Rottweilers, each taking 20 minutes to groom, the total time for Rottweilers is 6 * 20 = 120 minutes. For the 9 border collies, each taking 10 minutes to groom, the total time is 9 * 10 = 90 minutes. Lastly, the chihuahua takes 45 minutes to groom. Adding up all the times, we get 120 + 90 + 45 = 255 minutes.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: It will take Karen 255 minutes to groom 6 Rottweilers, 9 border collies, and 1 chihuahua.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294857.512562}
