We first need to calculate how many cans of pistachios James eats in 5 days by dividing the total amount he eats (30 ounces) by the amount in each can (5 ounces). This gives us 6 cans. Next, we need to calculate how much he spends on pistachios in 5 days by multiplying the number of cans he eats (6 cans) by the price per can ($10). This gives us $60. Finally, to find out how much he spends per week, we need to multiply the amount spent in 5 days ($60) by the number of 5-day periods in a week (7 days).\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: James spends $420 per week on pistachios.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295000.771557}
