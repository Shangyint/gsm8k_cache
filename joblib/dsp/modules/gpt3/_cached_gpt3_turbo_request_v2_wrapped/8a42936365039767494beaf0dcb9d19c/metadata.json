If Vivienne has 40 phones, and the two sisters sell their phones at $400 each, calculate the total amount of money they have together? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total amount of money they have together. First, we need to find out how many phones Aliyah has. Since she has 10 more phones than Vivienne, Aliyah has 40 + 10 = 50 phones. Next, we calculate the total number of phones they have together, which is 40 (Vivienne\\'s phones) + 50 (Aliyah\\'s phones) = 90 phones. Finally, we multiply the total number of phones (90) by the selling price of each phone ($400) to find the total amount of money they have together.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 90 phones * $400 = $36,000. Therefore, the two sisters have a total of $36,000 together.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294892.1308339}
