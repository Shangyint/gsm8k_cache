Her sister follows in a sailboat that has a speed of 12 miles per hour. If the lake is 60 miles wide, how long does Janet have to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the time it takes for Janet\\'s sister to catch up with her. The speed difference between the two boats is 30 - 12 = 18 miles per hour. To cover the 60-mile distance, Janet\\'s sister needs to catch up by 60 miles / 18 miles per hour = 3.33 hours.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 3.33 hours\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294331.078906}
