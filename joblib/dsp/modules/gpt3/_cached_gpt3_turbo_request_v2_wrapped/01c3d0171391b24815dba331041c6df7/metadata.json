How much change will he get from $350 if each liter of fuel costs $3?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to first calculate how many liters of fuel Donny needs to fill up his tank by subtracting the current amount of fuel from the total capacity. Then, we can multiply the number of liters needed by the cost per liter to find the total cost. Finally, we can subtract the total cost from the amount Donny paid to determine the change he will get back.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Donny needs 112 liters of fuel to fill up his tank (150 - 38 = 112). The total cost of filling up his tank would be $336 (112 liters x $3 per liter = $336). Therefore, Donny will get $14 in change from $350.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 150.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294846.597072}
