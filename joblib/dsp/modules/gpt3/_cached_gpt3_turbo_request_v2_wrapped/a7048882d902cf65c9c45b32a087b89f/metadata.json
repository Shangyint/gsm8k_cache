Of this group, 60% are women and there are 20 men. How many people are at the concert? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the total number of people at the concert. First, let\\'s assume the total number of people at the concert is represented by x. Since 2/3 of the audience was there for the second band, and 1/3 was there for the first band, we can calculate the number of people there for the second band as (2/3)x and for the first band as (1/3)x. Since 50% of the audience there for the second band is under the age of 30, we can calculate the number of people under 30 there for the second band as 0.5 * (2/3)x. Given that 60% of this group are women and there are 20 men, we can calculate the number of women under 30 there for the second band as 0.6 * 0.5 * (2/3)x. Adding the number of men and women under 30 there for the second band gives us the total number of people under 30 there for the second band. Finally, we can sum up the total number of people under 30 there for the second band and the total number of people there for the first band to find the total number of people at the concert.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The total number of people at the concert is 180.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295085.4911191}
