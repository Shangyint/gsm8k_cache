We will first calculate how much Dan made doing the lower-paid work and then calculate how much he made doing the higher-paid work. Finally, we will find the difference between the two amounts.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Dan made $100 doing the lower-paid work (400 tasks * $0.25/task) and $10 doing the higher-paid work (5 tasks * $2.00/task). The difference is $90 ($100 - $10), so Dan made $90 more doing the good work compared to the lower-paid work.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 400.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293318.4949849}
