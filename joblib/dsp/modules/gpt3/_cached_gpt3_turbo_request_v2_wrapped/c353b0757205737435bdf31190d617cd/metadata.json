How many inches tall is Tamara? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find Tamara\\'s height. Let\\'s represent Kim\\'s height as x inches. According to the question, Tamara is 3 times Kim\\'s height less 4 inches, so Tamara\\'s height can be represented as 3x - 4 inches. Since their combined height is 92 inches, we can create the equation x + (3x - 4) = 92 and solve for x to find Kim\\'s height. Once we find Kim\\'s height, we can substitute it back into the equation 3x - 4 to find Tamara\\'s height.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Tamara is 35 inches tall.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295016.017406}
