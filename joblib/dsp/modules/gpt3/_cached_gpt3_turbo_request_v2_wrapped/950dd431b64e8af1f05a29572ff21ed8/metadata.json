We know that Ray has 175 cents in nickels, which is equivalent to 35 nickels (since 1 nickel is 5 cents). Ray gives 30 cents (6 nickels) to Peter, leaving him with 29 nickels. Ray gives twice as many cents to Randi as he gave to Peter, which is 12 nickels (60 cents). Therefore, Randi has 35 nickels (remaining from Ray) + 12 nickels (from Ray) = 47 nickels. To find out how many more nickels Randi has than Peter, we subtract the number of nickels Peter has from the number Randi has: 47 - 29 = 18.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Randi has 18 more nickels than Peter.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 175.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294985.8586109}
