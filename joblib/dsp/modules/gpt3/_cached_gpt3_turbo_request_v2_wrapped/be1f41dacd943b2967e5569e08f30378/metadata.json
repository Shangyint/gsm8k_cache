Each chapter has three pages more than the previous one. How many pages does the first chapter have? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the number of pages in the first chapter. Let\\'s denote the number of pages in the first chapter as x. The second chapter will have x + 3 pages, the third chapter will have x + 6 pages, the fourth chapter will have x + 9 pages, and the fifth chapter will have x + 12 pages. Since the total number of pages in the book is 95, we can set up the equation x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + (x + 9) + (x + 12) = 95. Solving this equation, we get x = 15. Therefore, the first chapter has 15 pages.\\\\nAnswer:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715274573.175515}
