How many minutes does Marla spend on this errand in total?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that Marla spends 20 minutes driving one way to her son\\'s school, then 70 minutes at the parent-teacher night, and another 20 minutes driving back home. To find the total time spent on this errand, we need to add up these three time intervals: 20 + 70 + 20 = 110 minutes. However, we also need to consider the time spent driving both ways, so we need to double the driving time: 20 + 20 = 40 minutes. Adding this to the time spent at the parent-teacher night gives us a total of 70 + 40 = 110 minutes.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Marla spends a total of 110 minutes on this errand.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294678.855519}
