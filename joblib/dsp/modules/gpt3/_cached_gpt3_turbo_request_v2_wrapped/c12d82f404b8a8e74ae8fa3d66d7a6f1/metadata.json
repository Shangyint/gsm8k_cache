She picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked and her parents picked 93 strawberries less than her. If her brother picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, how many strawberries would they each have if they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many strawberries Kimberly picked, which is 8 times the amount her brother picked. Since her brother picked 3 baskets x 15 strawberries/basket = 45 strawberries, Kimberly picked 8 x 45 strawberries = 360 strawberries. Next, we need to find out how many strawberries her parents picked, which is 93 less than Kimberly. Therefore, her parents picked 360 strawberries - 93 strawberries = 267 strawberries. Adding up all the strawberries picked, we get 360 strawberries + 45 strawberries + 267 strawberries = 672 strawberries. If they divide the strawberries equally among the family members, each would have 672 strawberries / 4 = 168 strawberries.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Each family member would have 168 strawberries.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 8.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293330.1224918}
