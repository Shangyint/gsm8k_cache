How much more money does he need so he could buy the new computer?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We need to calculate the total amount of money Troy currently has, which is the sum of his initial savings and the money he will get from selling his old computer. Then, we subtract this total from the price of the new computer to find out how much more money he needs.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 10\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: John plays a game for 4 hours a day every day for 2 weeks. After all that time, he is only 40% done. He increased his playtime to 7 hours a day. How long until he finishes the game?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the total number of hours he played in two weeks, which is 4 hours a day for 14 days. This gives us a total of 56 hours played. Since he is only 40% done after this time, it means he needs 60% more to finish the game. When he increases his playtime to 7 hours a day, he will be playing 3 more hours each day. To find out how long it will take him to finish the game, we need to divide the remaining 60% of the game by the additional 3 hours he plays each day.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 20 days\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 4.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 2.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294346.837125}
