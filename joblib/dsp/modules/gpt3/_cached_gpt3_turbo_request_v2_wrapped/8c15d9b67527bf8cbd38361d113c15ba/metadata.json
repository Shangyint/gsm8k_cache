What is the fuel consumption of this car per 100 km?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total fuel consumed during the journey and then determine the fuel consumption per 100 km.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The total fuel consumed during the journey is 47 - 14 = 33 liters. To find the fuel consumption per 100 km, we divide the total fuel consumed by the total distance traveled and then multiply by 100. So, (33 liters / 275 km) * 100 = 12 liters per 100 km. Therefore, the fuel consumption of John\\'s car is 12 liters per 100 km.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 47.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294786.8264089}
