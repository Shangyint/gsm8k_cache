One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the total number of customers each woman served individually by multiplying the number of hours worked by the number of customers served per hour. Then, we can add up the total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julia to find the overall total.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Ann served 56 customers (8 hours * 7 customers per hour), Becky served 56 customers (8 hours * 7 customers per hour), and Julia served 42 customers (6 hours * 7 customers per hour). Therefore, all three women served a total of 154 customers that day (56 + 56 + 42).\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 8.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294996.022919}
