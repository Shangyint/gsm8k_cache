Each customer needs 1 can of hairspray during the styling and is also given 1 can of hairspray to take home. The salon also buys an extra 5 cans of hairspray each day to ensure there is never a shortage. If the salon buys 33 cans of hairspray every day, how many customers do they have each day?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that each customer needs 1 can of hairspray during the styling and is given 1 can to take home, totaling 2 cans per customer. The salon also buys an extra 5 cans each day, so the total cans needed per day is 2 cans per customer plus 5 extra cans. If they buy a total of 33 cans per day, we can set up the equation 2c + 5 = 33, where c represents the number of customers. Solving for c, we get c = 14.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The salon has 14 customers each day.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294970.469107}
