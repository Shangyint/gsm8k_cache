On the other stops, 22 passengers get off the bus and 5 passengers more get on the bus. How many passengers are there on the bus in total at the last station?\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 50.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We start with 50 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 16 more passengers get on, bringing the total to 50 + 16 = 66 passengers. Then, 22 passengers get off and 5 more get on, resulting in a total of 66 - 22 + 5 = 49 passengers on the bus at the last station.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: 49\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Mr. and Mrs. Boyden take their 3 children to a leisure park. They buy tickets for the whole family. The cost of an adult ticket is $6 more than the cost of a child ticket. The total cost of the 5 tickets is $77. What is the cost of an adult ticket?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can set up a system of equations to represent the given information. Let x be the cost of a child ticket and y be the cost of an adult ticket. We know that y = x + 6 and 3x + 2y = 77. By substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 3x + 2(x + 6) = 77. Solving this equation, we find that x = 11 and y = 17. Therefore, the cost of an adult ticket is $17.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 17\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 5.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293897.69752}
