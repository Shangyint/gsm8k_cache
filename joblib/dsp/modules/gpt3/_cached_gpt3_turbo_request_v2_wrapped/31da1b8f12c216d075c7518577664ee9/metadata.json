He found that he lacks rope for the activity so this week, he bought 4 feet less than last week. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, how many inches of ribbon did Mr. Sanchez buy in all?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how much rope Mr. Sanchez bought last week, which is 6 feet. Then, we need to find out how much rope he bought this week, which is 6 - 4 = 2 feet. Next, we convert the feet to inches by multiplying by 12. Finally, we add the inches of rope bought last week to the inches of rope bought this week to find the total number of inches.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Mr. Sanchez bought a total of (6 * 12) + (2 * 12) = 72 + 24 = 96 inches of rope.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294685.851385}
