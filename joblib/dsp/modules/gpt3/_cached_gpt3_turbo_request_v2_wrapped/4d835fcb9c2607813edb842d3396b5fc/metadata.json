A 10-pound bag of flour costs $10 and a 12-pound bag costs $13. When he is done making his bread, he has no use for flour and so he will throw away whatever is left. How much does he spend on flour if he buys the cheapest flour to get enough?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to first calculate how many pounds of flour Tommy needs in total, which is 12 loaves x 4 pounds per loaf = 48 pounds of flour. Next, we should determine how many bags of each size he needs to buy. Since he needs 48 pounds of flour, he can buy 4 bags of 12-pound flour (4 bags x $13 per bag = $52) to get enough flour. Finally, we calculate the total cost of the flour.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Tommy spends $52 on flour if he buys the cheapest flour to get enough.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 12.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294746.1614761}
