The next lock stalls them for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock. When Karen tries both locks at once, it stalled the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone. How long is that? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the answer. Let x be the time the second lock stalls the raccoons for. The first lock stalls them for 5 minutes. The next lock stalls them for 3(5) - 3 = 12 minutes. When both locks are used, they stall the raccoons for 5(12) = 60 minutes. Therefore, x + 12 = 60. Solving for x, we get x = 48 minutes.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The second lock stalls the raccoons for 48 minutes.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294941.8897548}
