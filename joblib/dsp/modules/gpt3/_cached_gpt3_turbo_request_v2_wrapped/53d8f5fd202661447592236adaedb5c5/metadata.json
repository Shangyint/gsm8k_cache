If there was a 10-minute intermission, and all the songs were 5 minutes except for one song that lasted 10 minutes, how many songs did she sing?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the concert lasted for 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is equivalent to 80 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 70 minutes left for the songs. If all the songs were 5 minutes except for one that was 10 minutes, we can set up the equation 5x + 10 = 70, where x represents the number of 5-minute songs. Solving for x, we get x = 12. Therefore, Jay sang a total of 13 songs.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jay sang a total of 13 songs.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295076.7550569}
