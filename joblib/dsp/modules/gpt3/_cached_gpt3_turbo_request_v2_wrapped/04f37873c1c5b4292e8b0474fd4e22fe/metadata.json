She recently went on a long trip to Bali. Palmer took 50 new pictures in the first week and twice that many in the second week. She was running out of space at the end of her trip and took only 80 new photos total across the third and fourth weeks. If she adds the pictures from Bali to her collection, how many total photos does Palmer have under her bed now?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can start by calculating the total number of photos Palmer took in Bali. In the first week, she took 50 photos, and in the second week, she took twice that amount, which is 50 x 2 = 100 photos. So in the first two weeks, she took 50 + 100 = 150 photos. In the third and fourth weeks, she took 80 more photos. Therefore, the total number of photos from Bali is 150 + 80 = 230 photos. Adding this to her existing collection of 100 photos, Palmer now has 100 + 230 = 330 total photos under her bed.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Palmer now has 330 total photos under her bed.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293344.093817}
