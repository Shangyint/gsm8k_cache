If Haley weighs 103 pounds, how many pounds do Verna and Sherry weigh together?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how much Verna weighs by adding 17 pounds to Haley\\'s weight. Then, we can find out how much Sherry weighs by doubling Verna\\'s weight. Finally, we can add Verna and Sherry\\'s weights together to get the total weight.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Verna weighs 120 pounds (103 + 17 = 120) and Sherry weighs 240 pounds (2 * 120 = 240). Therefore, Verna and Sherry weigh together 360 pounds (120 + 240 = 360).\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 103.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294656.688425}
