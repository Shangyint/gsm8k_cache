A 10-pound bag of flour costs $10 and a 12-pound bag costs $13. When he is done making his bread, he has no use for flour and so he will throw away whatever is left. How much does he spend on flour if he buys the cheapest flour to get enough?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to first calculate how many pounds of flour Tommy needs in total, then determine how many bags of each size he needs to buy, and finally calculate the total cost of the flour.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Tommy needs a total of 12 loaves x 4 pounds per loaf = 48 pounds of flour. He can buy either 5 bags of 10-pound flour (5 bags x $10 per bag = $50) or 4 bags of 12-pound flour (4 bags x $13 per bag = $52). Therefore, Tommy spends $50 on flour if he buys the cheapest option.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 12.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294743.4829178}
