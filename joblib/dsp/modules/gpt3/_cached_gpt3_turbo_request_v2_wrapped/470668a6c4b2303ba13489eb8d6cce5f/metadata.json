She finished by climbing a tree that was 200 feet taller than her first tree. What was the average height of the trees that Jackie climbed?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We will first calculate the height of the second and third trees. Since the second tree was half as tall as the first tree, it was 1000 / 2 = 500 feet tall. The third tree was 200 feet taller than the first tree, so it was 1000 + 200 = 1200 feet tall. To find the average height of all the trees, we will add up the heights of all the trees and divide by the total number of trees.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The average height of the trees that Jackie climbed is (1000 + 500 + 500 + 1200) / 4 = 800 feet.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 1000.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293190.930548}
