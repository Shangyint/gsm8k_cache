They order an appetizer that costs $10 and 4 entrees that are $20 each. If they tip 20% of the total for the waiter, what is the total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the total amount spent. First, we add the cost of the appetizer ($10) to the cost of the entrees (4 entrees x $20 each = $80) to get the subtotal. Then, we calculate the tip by finding 20% of the subtotal. Finally, we add the subtotal and the tip to get the total amount spent.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The total amount of money that Stefan and his family spend at the restaurant is $110.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294949.768621}
