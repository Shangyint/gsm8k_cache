In the morning, she was able to sell an average of 40 apples and 30 oranges. In the afternoon, she was able to sell 50 apples and 40 oranges. How much are her total sales for the day?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total sales for apples and oranges separately for both morning and afternoon. In the morning, Wendy sold a total of 40 + 30 = 70 fruits. In the afternoon, she sold a total of 50 + 40 = 90 fruits. So, in total, Wendy sold 70 + 90 = 160 fruits. Since half of the fruits sold were apples and the other half were oranges, we can calculate the total sales by multiplying the number of fruits sold by the price of each fruit.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Wendy\\'s total sales for the day is 160 fruits * $1.25 (average price per fruit) = $200.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 40.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295121.2918541}
