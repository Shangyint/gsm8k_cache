If each bottle costs $4.00, and he washes his car once a week for 20 weeks, how much does he spend on car soap?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. First, we need to find out how many bottles of car wash soap Jake needs for 20 weeks of washing his car once a week. We can do this by dividing the total number of car washes (20) by the number of washes per bottle (4), which gives us 5 bottles. Then, we multiply this number by the cost of one bottle ($4.00) to find out the total amount spent on car soap.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: $20.00\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 1.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294254.093645}
