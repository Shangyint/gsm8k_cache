Two-fifths of Lovely\\'s books can be sold for $2.50 each and the rest for $2 each. How much will Lovely earn if all 10 books were sold?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to determine that 2/5 of 10 books is equal to 4 books that can be sold for $2.50 each, and the remaining 6 books can be sold for $2 each. Then, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of books sold at each price by the respective price. Since Lovely has a total of 10 books, we need to ensure that all 10 books are accounted for in our calculations.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Lovely has 4 books that can be sold for $2.50 each and 6 books that can be sold for $2 each. Therefore, Lovely will earn (4 books * $2.50) + (6 books * $2) = $10 + $12 = $22 if all 10 books were sold.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 10.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294699.1640708}
