However, at the end of the school year, 1/3 of the students in Hendrix class had transferred to other schools. If the number of students that were in Hendrix\\'s class before 20 new students joined was 160, calculate the number of students that were in the class at the end of the year.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that before the 20 new students joined, there were 160 students in Hendrix\\'s class. After the 20 new students joined, the total number of students became 160 + 20 = 180. However, by the end of the school year, 1/3 of the students had transferred to other schools. This means that 1/3 of 180 students, which is (1/3) * 180 = 60 students, transferred out. Therefore, the number of students left in the class at the end of the year is 180 - 60 = 120.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 120 students.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295097.8473868}
