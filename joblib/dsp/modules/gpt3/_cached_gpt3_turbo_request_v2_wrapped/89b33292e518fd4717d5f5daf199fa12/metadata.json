She bought 3 times as many packets of drink mix as tent stakes. She also bought 2 more bottles of water than she did tent stakes. How many tent stakes did she buy?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the total number of items Rebecca bought is 22. Let\\'s represent the number of tent stakes as x. Since she bought 3 times as many packets of drink mix as tent stakes, the number of packets of drink mix she bought would be 3x. Additionally, she bought 2 more bottles of water than tent stakes, so the number of bottles of water she bought would be x + 2. The total number of items she bought can be represented as x + 3x + (x + 2) = 22. Solving this equation will give us the number of tent stakes she bought.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Rebecca bought 4 tent stakes.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293209.507212}
