Each sonnet is fourteen lines long. His lady fair tells him to leave her alone after he reads her only seven sonnets, and Horatio is heartbroken over the 70 romantic lines he wrote that she never heard. How many sonnets did Horatio write in all?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that each sonnet is fourteen lines long. Horatio read seven sonnets to his lady fair, which means she heard a total of 7 * 14 = 98 lines. Since she asked him to leave after the seventh sonnet, she never heard the remaining seven sonnets, which contain 7 * 14 = 98 lines. Therefore, Horatio wrote a total of 7 + 7 = 14 sonnets, which is a total of 14 * 14 = 196 lines. Since she only heard 98 lines, this means that Horatio wrote a total of 196 - 98 = 98 lines that she never heard. Since each sonnet is 14 lines long, this means that Horatio wrote a total of 98 / 14 = 7 sonnets that she never heard.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Horatio wrote a total of 14 sonnets.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 70.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294665.084597}
