From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what\\'s the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. Since Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, and Jenny collected 30 red marbles, Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 25 blue marbles, so Anie collected 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. Since Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we can find the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together by adding up the blue marbles collected by each of them: 25 (Mary) + 25 (Anie) + 25 (Jenny) = 75 blue marbles.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 75\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 20.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294931.880666}
