The students need to earn 200 points to win the movie day. Each time a student eats their vegetables at lunch she gives the student 2 points. There are 25 students in the class. If they have two school weeks, otherwise known as 10 days to win the movie, what is the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week to get a movie day?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the total number of points needed to win the movie day, which is 200 points. Then, we need to find out how many points each student needs to contribute on average. Since there are 25 students in the class, each student needs to contribute 200 points / 25 students = 8 points on average. Since each vegetable eaten earns 2 points, each student needs to eat 8 points / 2 points per vegetable = 4 vegetables on average per school week to win the movie day.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 4 vegetables\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 10.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295011.422092}
