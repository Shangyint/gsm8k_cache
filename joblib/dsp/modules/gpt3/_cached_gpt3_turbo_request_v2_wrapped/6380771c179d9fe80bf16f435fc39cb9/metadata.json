If basket A contains 15 apples, B has 30 mangoes, C has 20 peaches, D has 25 pears and E has some bananas, how many bananas are in basket E?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the average number of fruits per basket is 25, and there are a total of 5 baskets. This means that the total number of fruits in all 5 baskets is 25 * 5 = 125. We also know the number of fruits in baskets A, B, C, and D. By adding up the fruits in these baskets (15 + 30 + 20 + 25), we get a total of 90 fruits. To find the number of bananas in basket E, we subtract the total fruits in baskets A-D from the total fruits in all 5 baskets: 125 - 90 = 35 bananas.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: There are 35 bananas in basket E.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294689.740421}
