Jerry\\'s hose can normally pump 6 gallons/minute, but due to drought restrictions, it can only pump 2/3rds as fast right now. How many minutes will it take Jerry to fill his pond? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to calculate the time it will take Jerry to fill his pond. First, we need to find out how fast the hose is pumping water now. Since it can only pump 2/3rds as fast as normal, it is now pumping at a rate of 6 * 2/3 = 4 gallons/minute. Next, we divide the total amount of water in the pond (200 gallons) by the rate at which the hose is pumping water (4 gallons/minute) to find out how many minutes it will take to fill the pond.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: It will take Jerry 200 / 4 = 50 minutes to fill his pond.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293351.09074}
