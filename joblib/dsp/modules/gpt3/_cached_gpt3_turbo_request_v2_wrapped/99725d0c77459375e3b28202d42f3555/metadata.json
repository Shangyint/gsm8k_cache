How many cents can you save on each apple from buying $4 for 10 apples than from $3 for 6 apples?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We can first calculate the price per apple for each store by dividing the total price by the number of apples. For the first store, the price per apple is $3 / 6 apples = $0.50 per apple. For the second store, the price per apple is $4 / 10 apples = $0.40 per apple. Next, we can find the difference in price per apple between the two stores by subtracting the price per apple of the second store from the price per apple of the first store: $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10. To find the number of cents saved on each apple by buying $4 for 10 apples instead of $3 for 6 apples, we convert $0.10 to cents: $0.10 * 100 = 10 cents.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: You can save 10 cents on each apple by buying $4 for 10 apples instead of $3 for 6 apples.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 6.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294726.982864}
