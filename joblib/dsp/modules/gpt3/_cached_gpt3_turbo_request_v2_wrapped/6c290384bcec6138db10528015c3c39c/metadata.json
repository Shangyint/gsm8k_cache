How much more money does he need so he could buy the new computer?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer.

One by one, the dogs crawled into the dumpster, grabbed a mouthful of bones, and ran off with their newfound treasure. In all, there were 5 dogs. The first dog carried off 3 bones. The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog. The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog. The fourth dog carried off one bone, and the fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog carried, leaving no remaining bones in the dumpster. How many bones were in the original pile of bones?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that the first dog took 3 bones, the second dog took 2 bones, the third dog took 4 bones, the fourth dog took 1 bone, and the fifth dog took 2 bones. Adding these up, we get a total of 12 bones taken by the dogs. Since there were no bones left in the dumpster, the original pile must have contained 12 bones.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 12\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 5.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294249.928194}
