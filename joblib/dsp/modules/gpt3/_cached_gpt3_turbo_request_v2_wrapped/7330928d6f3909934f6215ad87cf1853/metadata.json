How many more candies does Andy now have than Caleb?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many candies each child had at the beginning. Billy had 6 candies, Caleb had 11, and Andy had 9. Their father gave 8 candies to Billy, 11 to Caleb, and the rest, which is 17 candies, to Andy. So, Billy now has 14 candies, Caleb has 22 candies, and Andy has 26 candies. To find out how many more candies Andy has than Caleb, we subtract 22 from 26, which equals 4.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Andy now has 4 more candies than Caleb.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 6.\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 36.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293264.916468}
