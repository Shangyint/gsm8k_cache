If they had 80 boxes to begin with and Ali makes 5 circles, how many circles can Ernie make?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: find the answer. First, we need to determine how many boxes Ali used in total by multiplying 8 by the number of circles he made (5 circles x 8 boxes = 40 boxes). Next, we subtract the boxes Ali used from the total number of boxes to find out how many boxes Ernie has left (80 boxes - 40 boxes = 40 boxes). Since Ernie uses 10 boxes for each circle, we can divide the remaining boxes by 10 to find out how many circles Ernie can make (40 boxes \\\\u00f7 10 boxes = 4 circles).\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Ernie can make 4 circles.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295037.0858722}
