Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. If Haley has 25 necklaces, how many more necklaces does Haley have than Josh? Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to find the answer. First, we need to determine how many necklaces Jason has. Since Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason and Haley has 25 necklaces, Jason has 25 - 5 = 20 necklaces. Next, we need to find out how many necklaces Josh has. Since Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason, Josh has 20 / 2 = 10 necklaces. Finally, we can calculate how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh by subtracting Josh\\'s number of necklaces from Haley\\'s number of necklaces: 25 - 10 = 15.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Haley has 15 more necklaces than Josh.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293210.732089}
