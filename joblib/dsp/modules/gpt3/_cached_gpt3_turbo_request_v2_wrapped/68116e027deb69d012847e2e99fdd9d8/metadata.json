If she is paid $.50 per mile, how much money does she make if she drives for 10 hours?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many gallons of gas she will need for 10 hours of driving at 30 miles per hour. Then, we can calculate the total cost of gas. Next, we can calculate how many miles she will drive in 10 hours and multiply that by the rate she is paid per mile to find out how much money she makes.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The truck driver will need 3 gallons of gas (10 miles per gallon x 30 miles per hour x 10 hours = 300 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 30 gallons x $2 per gallon = $60). She will drive 300 miles in 10 hours, so she will make $150 (300 miles x $.50 per mile = $150). After subtracting the cost of gas, she will make $90 ($150 - $60 = $90) driving for 10 hours.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294861.4215171}
