Each cub needs 35 pounds a week and she has 4 cubs. She hunts rabbits, which are five pounds each. If she hunts daily, how many rabbits does she need to catch each day?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate the total amount of meat needed per week for the bear and her cubs. The bear needs 210 pounds of meat in a week, and each cub needs 35 pounds a week, with a total of 4 cubs. Therefore, the total meat needed per week is 210 + (35 * 4) = 350 pounds. Since she hunts daily, we can determine how many rabbits she needs to catch each day by dividing the total weekly meat requirement by the number of days she hunts in a week.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: The bear needs to catch 70 rabbits each day.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 210.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715294668.895839}
