Each student needs 5 pens, 3 notebooks, 1 binder and 2 highlighters. Pens cost $0.50, notebooks cost $1.25, binders cost $4.25, and highlighters cost $0.75. If Jackson gets a $100 teacher discount, how much does he spend on school supplies?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We need to calculate the total cost of all the supplies needed for 30 students. Each student needs 5 pens, 3 notebooks, 1 binder, and 2 highlighters, so for 30 students, Jackson needs to buy 150 pens, 90 notebooks, 30 binders, and 60 highlighters. We then multiply the quantity of each item by its respective cost and add them all up. After that, we subtract the $100 teacher discount to find the final amount spent.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: Jackson spends a total of $255 on school supplies.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nYour Reasoning should contain 30.\\\\nYour Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293175.5206232}
