If the school has 300 students, how many students are non-foreign male students?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We know that 2/3 of the population are females, so 1/3 are males. Since the school has 300 students, 1/3 of them are males, which is 300 * 1/3 = 100 males. One-tenth of the males are foreign students, so there are 100 * 1/10 = 10 foreign male students. Therefore, the number of non-foreign male students is 100 - 10 = 90.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 90 students\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293195.950786}
