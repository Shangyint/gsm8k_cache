To make an Oreo cheesecake, Lionel needs 2 boxes of Graham crackers and 3 packets of Oreos. After making the maximum number of Oreo cheesecakes he can with the ingredients he bought, how many boxes of Graham crackers would he have left over?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: produce the answer. We first need to calculate how many Oreo cheesecakes Lionel can make with the ingredients he bought. To do this, we divide the number of Graham crackers by 2 (since 2 boxes are needed for each cheesecake) and the number of Oreos by 3 (since 3 packets are needed for each cheesecake). After calculating, we find that Lionel can make 7 Oreo cheesecakes. Since each cheesecake requires 2 boxes of Graham crackers, he would have used 14 boxes in total. Therefore, he would have 0 boxes of Graham crackers left over.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: 0\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Reasoning should contain 15.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715295124.821805}
