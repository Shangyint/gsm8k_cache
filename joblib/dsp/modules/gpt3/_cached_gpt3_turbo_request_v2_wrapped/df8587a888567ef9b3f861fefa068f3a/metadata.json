He increased his playtime to 7 hours a day. How long until he finishes the game?\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Reasoning: calculate the total hours needed to finish the game. First, we find out how many hours John plays in 2 weeks at 4 hours per day. Total hours played in 2 weeks = 4 hours/day * 7 days/week * 2 weeks = 56 hours Next, we calculate how many hours he has left to play based on being 40% done. Total hours needed to finish the game = Total hours played / 0.4 = 56 hours / 0.4 = 140 hours Hours left to play = Total hours needed - Total hours played = 140 hours - 56 hours = 84 hours Finally, we determine how many days it will take him to finish the game at 7 hours per day. Days to finish the game = Hours left to play / 7 hours/day = 84 hours / 7 hours/day = 12 days\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Answer: It will take John 12 more days to finish the game.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions: Your Answer should be a number.\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1715293305.1761322}
