Each large box takes 4 feet of packing tape to seal, each medium box takes 2 feet of packing tape to seal, and each small box takes 1 foot of packing tape to seal.

First, we calculate the tape used for the large boxes: 2 large boxes * 4 feet per box = 8 feet. Next, we calculate the tape used for the medium boxes: 8 medium boxes * 2 feet per box = 16 feet. Then, we calculate the tape used for the small boxes: 5 small boxes * 1 foot per box = 5 feet. Finally, we add the tape used for the address labels: 15 boxes * 1 foot per box = 15 feet. Adding all these up, we get 8 + 16 + 5 + 15 = 44 feet.\\\\nAnswer: 44\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Sandy\\'s monthly phone bill expense is equal to ten times her age now.
